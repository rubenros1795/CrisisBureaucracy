I be depressed to hear the Financial Secretary say last night that 60p out of every Â£ 1 that we have save this year in the retrenchment programme have be on the capital rather than on current account .I have hope that we would manage to do well than that .we must try to ensure that we do not continuously achieve economy in service to the public while maintain the intact army of bureaucracy , or , in the case of local authority , constantly expand .there be much work to be do .
