indeed , one of my colleague on the committee , Mr. Dipak Nandy , say fairly clearly in the Sunday Times at the weekend that the committee would not itself have make such a proposal .we agonise thoroughly over the question of what to do with the BBC , and because we be divide 10 to six and could not ourselves make up our mind , we present the Government with two choice â€” either to divide the BBC in the interest of great editorial diversity and as one way of get rid of the layer of coordinate bureaucracy , or to leave well alone but stop its expansion into new medium field .the Government have let it go ahead with new expansion and have make a rather muffed gesture towards the principle of decentralisation .
