perhaps in future it might be wise to bring all these body together .perhaps in time to come we can evolve some form of regional authority , but it should be as a replacement for a tier of authority , not an addition to it .an extra tier of bureaucracy in Scotland and Wales or any of the region of England , be completely unnecessary and highly expensive .the people be feed up with over - much interference .they want less , not more , government .
