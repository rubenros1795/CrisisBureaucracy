those be just a few example that I hope in future , if I catch your eye again , Mr. Deputy Speaker , to bring to the attention of the House .although in that June many hundred of year ago we in this land try to create the concept of individual civil liberty , we be now in danger of run down the path where , for the sake of administrative and other convenience — because we be frighten by some event — we be begin to negate the fundamental principle that all man be free and that all man have equal right .the Opposition have be accuse of wish to control society from the centre .I ask conservative member to consider carefully the legislation propose in the gracious Speech , because it contain many element of that centralise , orwellian concept of Big Brother , bureaucracy know good , and that the individual have few right and that those that he have be slowly be negate .
