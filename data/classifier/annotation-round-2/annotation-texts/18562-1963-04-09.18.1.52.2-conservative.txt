there be a very valuable sector of the bureaucracy know as the Treasury Information Division .it be not so retire as the head of the Department himself , because in a publication which arrive on my desk the day before Budget day call , Trade Expansion , look ahead — New Series , no .1 , the Treasury Information Division say in its concluding word : export must increase by 5 per cent .a year — from £ 3,863 million in 1961 to £ 4,940 million in 1966 .if that have be put out by the Treasury Information Division , why do the President of the Board of Trade refuse to confirm figure of that kind when ask a direct question in this Committee ?I be one of his principal aide and assistant in the endeavour to increase export .it would have be far well for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to acknowledge the validity of the statement by the Treasury Information Division , and use it in his speech .
