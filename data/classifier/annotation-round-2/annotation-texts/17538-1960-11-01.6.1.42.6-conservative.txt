I be not advocate that this should become a national responsibility , but I certainly think that it ought to become a county council problem .I be afraid that if it be to become a national problem we should get a great deal of red tape and bureaucracy come into it .however , I be certain that the present system be totally unsatisfactory and that modernisation should be either on the basis of it become the responsibility of the county council or that there should be some national grant to the river board and the internal drainage board .the position be certainly such that the burden to these small community have not be satisfactorily look at .
