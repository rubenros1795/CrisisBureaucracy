I welcome the provision for a local government ombudsman , but I hope that the local commissioner will be use sparingly , almost as a court of appeal of last resort rather than one of first resort .in the ordinary course of event the average citizen 's mean of redress in connection with a local government grievance should be his locally elect representative who should be perfectly capable of deal with the vast majority of problem .if the ombudsman be over - use , so will their bureaucracy grow and before long we shall have to have another sort of ombudsman to look into the ombudsman .
