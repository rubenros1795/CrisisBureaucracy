I make two suggestion to try to cope with the problem as I see they .it be not good enough to aim simply to contain the growth of bureaucracy .we must aim to introduce cut and reduction by transfer civil servant to productive industry .practically all big industry and business do not hesitate to make use of business consultancy and business efficiency firm to advise they .I see no stigma attach to this .I see no reason why the Civil Service should not use outside business consultant .my respect for the Roman Catholic Church be greatly enhance when it undergo this sort of examination .I be most interested when it come out equal to Standard Oil , New Jersey .
