that shift have be quietly pursue by both Labour and Tory government alike , and have be bring to its ultimate conclusion by this Government .they promise differently , of course .the conservative manifesto of 1983 say : the conservative party believe in encourage people to take responsibility for their own decision .however , no government in recent time have more enthusiastically and systematically destroy local government than this one .the final coup de grace come yesterday with the announcement of the long - expect rate - cap legislation .Insidiously , the constitution have be change .local government be now a hollow sham , whose duty be little more than act as a land agent for Westminster .meanwhile , Parliament have have to deal with everything from the issue of dog licence to the declaration of war .I remind hon .member that not many week ago we do just that .at 4 pm we talk about dog nuisance and at 7 pm about cruise missile .meanwhile , the bureaucracy , that fourth and perhaps most powerful estate in the british constitution , have grow fat and more powerful on the fruit of institutional centralisation .
