on the day follow the publication of our White Paper , the Western Mail say in an editorial : More than a year ago we write in favour of a ministerial system in the Assembly and against the adoption of a committee system , argue a need for effective as well as more democratic government .local government committee be often ineffective and accountability be dilute by the diffusion of responsibility .however , the White Paper propose a judicious blend of both system , provide in practice for clear responsibility through the executive member and for the constructive involvement of all Assembly member , from whatever party , in policy formulation .I believe that rather than increase the force of bureaucracy we be strengthen the force of democracy in Wales .
