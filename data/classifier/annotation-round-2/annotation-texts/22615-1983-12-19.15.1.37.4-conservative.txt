we must have equal joint action by the two county council where there be an affinity of interest or of problem .a mechanism , without bureaucracy , already exist for that through a joint committee , which work well .it would be unacceptable to have an elect regional government for Devon and Cornwall .I can tell the House something for nothing â€” that would cost a great deal more than we now spend on local government service in the two county .
