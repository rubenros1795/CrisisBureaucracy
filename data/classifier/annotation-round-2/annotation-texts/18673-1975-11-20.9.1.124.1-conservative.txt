I ask the hon .gentleman to look at the present scale of the deficit and to remember that at that time the nationalise industry be not the main source of inflation in the country as they be today and nor be the level of inflation as serious as it now be .we all know the kind of statement contain in our postbag from constituent who claim the converse of cost - effectiveness in the nationalise industry .I do not blame those who run and work in the nationalise industry who may be wrongly accuse of wastefulness , extravagance and over manning , but in their interest I believe that such information should be seek and make public as soon as possible .I do not blame those people because the problem be in the nature of the beast â€” it lie in the stifling bureaucracy of the organisation and its structure , which cause these deficience .
