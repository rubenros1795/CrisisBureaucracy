in short , therefore , I say that this sort of legislation proliferate a wholly unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and planning control .office development should well be leave to those who know good about it â€” namely , the regional planning authority or other form of local planning authority .when the present legislation expire on 4th August it should be allow to stay expire .it have serve its purpose and it should go .I be pleased that the Opposition have take a hard line against it .
