the main role of local government should not be to initiate land purchase for private development .it may have a useful back - up function in voluntary co - operation with private developer , just as it have do for many year in city centre redevelopment .industrial site in particular may also be assemble in that way .but it be undesirable in principle and unworkable in practice that the organisation to which Parliament have give the duty of decide whether to grant planning permission should also seek to be the dominant force in the market for buy land .that be why the Community Land Act be fail and that be why it will continue to fail .that way — the State trading way — lie bad planning , slow development , the risk of corruption and the certainty of increase bureaucracy and expense .
