in paragraph 239 , the Committee say : by this standard we think the 1876 Act have be generally effective ; no licensee appear to regard it as a piece of useless bureaucracy , many leave we in no doubt of their high respect for it .the Act have be effective partly because it have command the ready support of those subject to it , partly because the Home Office have adopt a wide interpretation , insist on humane standard , and administer the law conscientiously .experience have aptly confirm the value of a system of individual licensing .paragraph 234 sum up to a large extent the basic issue with which we be concerned today .it say : as be the case in most other institution it be the attitude of colleague and climate of opinion within the laboratory that be the chief check upon irresponsibility .police - type inspection from outside can not possibly secure the same continuous discipline in community of this kind .a further factor be the grow competition for scientific resource which be a stand discouragement to wastage whether of expert manpower , premise , money or experimental material .even without the Act these factor would all continue to operate in favour of humane treatment of animal .it be not altogether surprising , therefore , that the criticism we have receive of the Act have be accompany by very few allegation of the infliction of extreme cruelty or of unsatisfactory care .from our own visit to laboratory and discussion with licensee and animal attendant we have be greatly impressed with the prevail standard of humanity and with the condition of the animal we have see .we have see no foundation whatever for any general suspicion , let alone sharp criticism , of the concern of licensee for their animal .I heartily endorse what the hon .and learn Gentleman say about the little - wood report in no way be a possible vehicle for either bring experimentation on live animal to an end or drastically reduce the number of experiment carry out year by year .in the two very happy year I have as a junior Minister at the Home Office , I do not have the opportunity to deal with this matter .it do not belong to my side of the House , as it be , and therefore in a sense I come to this controversy with a fresh mind , although , I hope , not tabula rasa .
