like other hon .member on both side of the House , I can not claim to be an enthusiastic supporter of the exist two - tier local government structure in the metropolitan area .from my probably prejudiced standpoint as a former London borough council leader , my experience be that the two - tier system have confuse the elector , who can seldom remember which tier do what , and have build - in duplication , bureaucracy and conflict , as problem and paper shuffle between two tier of local government .
