a lady in my constituency write to I last week that , have earn about £ 8 per week in part - time employment in the past three year , she have just realise to her great dismay that she should have declare those earning because they exceed the amount that she be entitle to earn while still receive supplementary benefit .be honest and honourable , she write to the Department and declare those earning .not surprisingly , give the strict rule by which the bureaucracy of this country be run , she receive a bill for £ 285 for back payment .naturally , she do not have such a sum .luckily , however , a member of her family come to her aid and make the repayment for she .nevertheless , it be appal that a person who earn such a modest amount in addition to supplementary benefit should be ask to repay such a sum , give the present great difficulty of find full - time employment .
