obviously , urgent repair will be tackle under the maintenance scheme , but what a tenant may consider urgent and what a local authority housing department inspector may consider urgent be an extremely subjective area .there be , therefore , considerable room for dispute .I be never sure about how London organise itself , but Birmingham be probably the large single housing authority in the country .certainly , in Birmingham we have the bureaucracy to go with it .
