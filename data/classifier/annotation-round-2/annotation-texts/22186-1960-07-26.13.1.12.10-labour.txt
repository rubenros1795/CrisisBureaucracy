I be inform that effort have be make locally to try to put this matter right .they have no desire to trouble the House , or the Joint Parliamentary Secretary 's Department , but they have a profound desire to help the people live in the district to remedy this grievance .they have be meet with bureaucracy .I be not prepared to say how far that be true , but they feel the meanness of the autocratic attitude of the Manchester Ship Canal so much that they decide to send their complaint to my hon .friend the Member for Newton ( Mr. Lee ) in whose division Irlam be situate .when a state of affair like that arise , it be about time that somebody , somewhere , sit up and take notice .this have be go on for many year , and I hope therefore that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary will consider the problem of pollution .
