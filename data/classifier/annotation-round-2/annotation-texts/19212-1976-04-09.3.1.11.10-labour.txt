the growth of the bureaucracy be , of course , not confine to the public sector .it exist in private industry also .but it tend to be bad in public enterprise , because in that sector the union be well able to protect their position and stop the adoption of efficient technique .I see that for myself when I be Postmaster - General .I realise how difficult it be for anyone to break down the vested interest of the Post Office union and to destroy the overmanning which blatantly exist in that sector .
