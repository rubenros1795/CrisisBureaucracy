as to this multifariousness , this duplication , this waste of time and multiplication of bureaucracy , that be primarily the fault of this country more than of any other .the only way in which this proliferation can be solve be to bring these body together under one roof and have all the member of the parliamentary council member of all the body , otherwise the Council can not have authority over the separate body .we can not expect that we or the scandinavian country , or Poland if she come in , should have authority in a Council of Europe to control , direct or instruct the Coal and Steel Community or Euratom unless we be all member .this be the only way that we can do it effectively , and we might as well face the fact .
