I shall deal in a moment with this question of the increase in bureaucracy , because it be greatly exaggerated in the context of vat .what I object to be the proliferation of unnecessary Government official brew up tea , occupy office space , and so on .I do not think there need necessarily be any huge increase in bureaucracy arise directly from VAT .
