secondly , every quango generate its own bureaucracy and cost .Quangos have do so in the past , whatever responsibility they have have .miracle happen , but not very often .I fear that , if district health council be establish , the expect saving of Â£ 30 million on bureaucracy will prove meaningless .I shall give two small example to illustrate my argument .there be currently 17 member of the Wiltshire area health authority .if each of the three district within that authority become an authority in itself , there could be a total of 60 appoint member .the consultative paper suggest that there could be up to 20 member of each district health authority .if there be 60 in total in Wiltshire , the cost of travel and of service the 60 will not be inconsiderable .
