we be ask for a fairly limited number of staff .we be not ask for the continuation of a vast bureaucracy , but if we do not act soon those people will move elsewhere .indeed , some have already go .who be to blame they for do so with such uncertainty hang over the corporation for such a long time ?even dedicated people must look after their own future .the time when the Minister should have be make clear his intention have long go .if he can not tell we tonight what they be , he must at least tell we when an announcement will be make .he must not delay it for long because already skilled and knowledgeable people be leave .they be go away from their area , and they will be lose to the urgent task of win new job to our area .
