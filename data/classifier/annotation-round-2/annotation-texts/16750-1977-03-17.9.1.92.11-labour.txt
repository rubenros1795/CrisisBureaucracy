there be an advantage in this from the point of view of the House .if we have large permanent staff of expert we should set up a parliamentary bureaucracy .Bureaucracy be very often criticise when it be in the form of the Civil Service , but it would be no well for be a parliamentary bureaucracy .I have refer to this on previous occasion .in the United States the very large number of people who be serve committee full - time build up on inertia in those committee , a sort of perpetuation , which do not and can not happen here at present with the Expenditure Committee .we should be well on our guard to resist that .
