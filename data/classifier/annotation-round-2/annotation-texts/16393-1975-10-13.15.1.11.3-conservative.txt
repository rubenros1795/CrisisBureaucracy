I have no comment to make on politician in general , theologian in general , dwarf in general , Africans in general or bureaucrat in general ; nevertheless , I believe that if one examine the various States of the world and their community one find that those that be poor , the most depressed and least successful be those that have hand all function over to a bureaucracy .
