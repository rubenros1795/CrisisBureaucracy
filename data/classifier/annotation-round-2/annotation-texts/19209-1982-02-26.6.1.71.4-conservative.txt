look back , most people would agree that the Government , in the early 1970 , make a catastrophic mistake by reorganise local government as they do .not only be old place name destroy for ever , but people lose their familiar landmark which be so love in England , and the new authority , so often remote from those whom they be suppose to serve , allow a vast new bureaucracy to be create which have be more difficult to control than even the Civil Service .the creation of new water authority — which have not be mention today — cause similar , if not great , problem .
