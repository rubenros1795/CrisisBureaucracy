I now want to turn to the recommendation that we make .it be rarely recognise — although it ought to be — that the unique feature of our abortion law be that the evidence of two register medical practitioner be require before an abortion can take place .I be all in favour of that .one have only to think of the condition of pregnant woman to realise how distressing it be for they in other country to have to go through the official machinery and to face bureaucracy in seek abortion .but I emphasise that two register practitioner , not one , be require under the 1967 Act .
