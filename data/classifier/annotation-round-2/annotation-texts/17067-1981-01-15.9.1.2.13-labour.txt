I should also like the Scottish Office to examine the exist procedure for deal with housing association work on rehabilitation project with a view to cut out unnecessary bureaucracy and double scrutiny by both the Housing Corporation and the Scottish Development Department , because at the end of the day it add to cost and frustration .the examination should include a realistic appraisal of exist cost limit , especially for project involve the amalgamation or the integration of flat into big and more suitable housing unit , so that bathroom , kitchen or extra bedroom be fit in .even after rehabilitation , many of these flat , as the Minister will know , have a small floor space compare with equivalent public sector housing provision .
