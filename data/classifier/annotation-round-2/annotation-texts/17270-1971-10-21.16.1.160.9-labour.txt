the bureaucracy of the six be also a significant feature in the argument .last year the country of the E.E.C.hold a coal mining conference in , of all place , Spain .it be discover that Belgium and Holland have plan practically to wipe out their coal mining industry by 1963 .when it be point out that world demand for energy be such that indigenous dutch resource could not meet dutch demand so that it be folly to run down the industry at such a catastrophic rate , the reply from Belgium and Holland be that it be too late to turn back .be this the kind of organisation of which we be to become a member , so bureaucratic and hidebound that once plan be find to be wrong there be no turning back ?
