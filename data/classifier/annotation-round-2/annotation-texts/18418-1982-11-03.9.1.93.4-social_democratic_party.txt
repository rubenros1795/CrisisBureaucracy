I be convinced that part of the problem of unemployment in Britain can not be solve by Britain alone .one of the more positive aspect of the Community — and one of the aspect which could identify with ordinary people rather than the bureaucracy and the wrangle over budget — relate to the possibility of have a co - ordinated response to the problem of unemployment .although the Prime Minister attend the various summit meeting , one be always leave with the feeling that she go with little enthusiasm and with few idea .
