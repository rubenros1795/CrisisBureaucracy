I believe that , if the Victorians have have to work with the same jumble of red tape as our industry do , there would not have be the first industrial revolution .Stephenson would never have be an engineer â€” he would have be either a civil servant or an accountant .although my right hon .friend have do much to cut out red tape and to get rid of bureaucracy , more still need to be do .
