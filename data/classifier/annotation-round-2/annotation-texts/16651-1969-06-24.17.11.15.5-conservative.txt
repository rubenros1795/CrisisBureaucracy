my enjoyment of the holiday be only slightly affect by the immense bureaucracy which be be superimpose in those country .I find it in the sense that holiday register be more complex than in Britain .it would be do a disservice to tourism in East Africa if we be to encourage its contact with this country to be channel through governmental rather than through free enterprise entrepreneurial agency .
