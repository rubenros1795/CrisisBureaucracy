I understand that a whole committee of the Ministry of Public Building and Works have to inspect the premise before a decision can be make .that result in some private enterprise buyer get in first , with power to make a decision , and the Post Office find itself shut out .could not the Postmaster - General make representation to his right hon .friend the Minister of Public Building and Works to get this procedure simplify ?it be ridiculous that a person hold the position of postmaster of a considerable district — I cite this because my constituency be in the Harrow and Wembley district — should not be able to come to a decision within certain limit that he can spend money on such premise without have to refer it to a committee of the Ministry of Public Building and work .that be a piece of bureaucracy handicap the Post Office and I hope that the right hon .Gentleman will take up the matter .
