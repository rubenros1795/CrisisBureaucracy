may I now deal with the central , specific recommendation of the Dooge committee : the abolition of the veto in meeting of the European Council , increase power for the European Parliament , and reform of the internal common market .first , nobody minimise the frustration of the european Members of Parliament who be deny any real role in the European Assembly .they be catch up in the web of bureaucracy and the lost direction of the Community .however , that alone be not a reason for increase the power of the European Parliament .there appear to be a degree of unanimity between the Government and the Opposition on that point .
