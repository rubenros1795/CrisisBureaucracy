"the new clause be not particularly helpful .it do not go nearly far enough .the Minister of State describe it as an annual business plan .that be all very well .however , the new clause refer to guidance give by the Secretary of State as to the form and content of the plan "" .in other word , it will not be the plan of London Regional Transport ; it will be the Secretary of State 's plan .those word would not appear at the end of the clause if centralise bureaucracy do not intend to exercise its power .if that be no so , no doubt the Ministers will tell we why those word be include ."
