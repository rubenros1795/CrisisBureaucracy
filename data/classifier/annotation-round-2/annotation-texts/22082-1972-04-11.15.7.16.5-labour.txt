television company largely put together their programme schedule ponderously and far in advance , with enormous capital outlay and ample opportunity for the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the Authority to examine and decide , if it wish to decide , the meritorious nature or otherwise of the programme .but , as the ex - pirate from Brighouse and Spenborough and other have remark , radio be much free and easy and fast , and there be much more instant broadcasting , so there will not be that amount of application to the Authority , which will not be able to seek out merit and insist upon it , at least in advance , although it may have something to say ex poste facto about it in the way it have theoretically be able to do in the case of television .
