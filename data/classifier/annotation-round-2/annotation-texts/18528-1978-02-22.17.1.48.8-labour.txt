we be empower the General Medical Council to set up these council .they will have to be set up under the Bill , but the GMC will decide , in the light of practical requirement , whether the branch council will be use .it will decide that in the light of pragmatic experience .if it come to the conclusion that there be no justifiable need for the branch council , it need not use they .I assume that in such circumstance the council need not meet , and they certainly would not require any of the elaborate bureaucracy of which hon .member , be rightly afraid , in view of the experience we have have in the National Health Service over the past few year .
