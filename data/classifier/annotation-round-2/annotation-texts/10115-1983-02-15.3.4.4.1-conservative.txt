I can give an assurance on the last point .we be propose to reduce bureaucracy and administration and release resource for service development .at the moment fpc be responsible direct to the Secretary of State for the administration of the service .our legislation will enable they to employ their own staff direct and be responsible for their own management .we believe that that will lead to more efficient administration , which will release yet more money for an improvement in service .
