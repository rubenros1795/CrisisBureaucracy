the fact that , in this session we be , I believe , consider only 17 major bill , be desirable in view of the present constraint of the british economy , but the small load of legislation be due partly to the claim on parliamentary time of the devolution Bill .one aspect of devolution that hon .member be liable to forget be that , whether or not it be justified , it can have serious consequence in term of growth of bureaucracy and of public expenditure .it may sound attractive to say that as we be propose to grant a measure of devolution to Scotland and Wales we should have some kind of devolution in England , but I have great reservation about any reform that introduce a further tier of local government .
