it be extraordinary that the Parliamentary Secretary do not think fit to bring someone from the Home Office with he to explain why the anomaly exist .I be not involve in this from a constituency point of view .I have listen carefully to all that my hon .friend have have to say and it be apparent that there have be consultation with local authority .as be so often the case with consultation between this Government and local authority , it have be totally ignore .it be obvious that , for the sake of a package , there have to be two form where one would have do very well .the city of Liverpool and Leicester have do a first - class job , they have impose high standard than the Ministry impose , and it be nothing short of shortsightedness on the part of the bureaucracy to insist on this order .
