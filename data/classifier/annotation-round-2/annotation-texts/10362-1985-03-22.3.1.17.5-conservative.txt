overlap with export subsidy be state development aid , whereby this country , through its government , try to help other government to develop their economy .for many year , I work as a consultant economist , mainly in underdeveloped country and on aid project .I should like to make a few point in the light of my experience .first , I think that there be a more limited scope for this form of Government - to - government aid to assist development than be often suppose .secondly , inevitably this aid involve a great deal of bureaucracy .thirdly , few of the project that be beneficiary of aid could not be do as well , if not well , by private enterprise act in response to the natural incentive of the market place .
