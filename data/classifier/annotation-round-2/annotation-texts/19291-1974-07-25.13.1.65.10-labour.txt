as for bureaucracy in our society , I be sure that we can all tell story about the way that it function and about its impersonality .Max Weber and other write about it in the early day .they describe the way in which those who be weak and humble could be subject to violence by the bureaucracy in our huge organisation .the State itself be guilty of violence .it be guilty of violence when it decide that there may be a prima facie case against a widow who take a lodger .the State seek to discover whether the lodger be co - habiting with the widow .if there be any suggestion that that may be the case , the bureaucrat deprive she of benefit to which she may otherwise be entitle .
