a designation order be a most important matter , not only to the locality concerned but to the whole region in which the new town be to lie .if the Minister can not convince Parliament about it he will not be able to convince local opinion about it , either .therefore , the establishment , or enlargement , of a new town will be an act of bureaucracy and not of democracy .as a supporter of the new town idea I regard this as a pity .
