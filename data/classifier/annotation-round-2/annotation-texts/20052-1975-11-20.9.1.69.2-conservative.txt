I deplore the fact that in this Queen 's Speech there be no attempt to control the ever - pervade bureaucracy that be come up and up upon the back of our industrialist .the hon .member for New - castle - upon - Tyne , East make a certain play with the small corner shop , and he say that price be high .but the small private business man be bully and badger by bureaucrat of every sort .the movement that we have see in recent month among the self - employ and small business man , complain about vat or the collection of vat and about their national insurance contribution , and all the fear and anxiety that the self - employ have be voice , be nothing as compare with the way in which they be bully and badger by bureaucracy .
