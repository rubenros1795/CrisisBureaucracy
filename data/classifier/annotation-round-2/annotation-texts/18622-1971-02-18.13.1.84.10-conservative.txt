I want to outline some thought of my own which be not of a party political nature .I believe that historical analogy be seldom apt , but when I contemplate the revolution of the nineteenth century which topple the royalist from their seat and finally compel they to accept the rule of law , I recall that everyone at that time look upon the rule of law as the rampart of liberty , and it sustain the expectation of the western world for many year and still , indeed , sustain the expectation and confidence of the old generation in this country today .but we have another sort of revolution in the western world at the present .this time it seem to be against the rule of law as be the enemy of liberty .the right hon .Gentleman , who talk of unity , be note for be a supporter and an enthusiast for certain element of the young generation in our society who I feel regard the rule of law as be the enemy of liberty .we be all in search of a basis on which citizen may be protect against the institutional abuse of power by the royalist of the 20th century â€” the trade union , the Press , big business and bureaucracy .
