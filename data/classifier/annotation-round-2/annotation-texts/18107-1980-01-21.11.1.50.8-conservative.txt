there have be a suggestion that there should be a development area for the North .those who advocate such thing usually have no experience of business .I know several people in the Lancaster area who be extremely successful in attract business to Lancashire .those who know about business do not advocate a development area for the North .at good , it be an excuse for throw money at the problem and not take any action at all .at worst , it become a drain on public fund and a gross addition to an already overweighte bureaucracy .
