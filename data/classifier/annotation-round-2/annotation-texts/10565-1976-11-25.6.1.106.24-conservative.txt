but , unlike the job creation programme , they would get a realistic wage for the job rather than the inflated rate of pay which be make under the Government scheme .I would propose that the rate for the job be the present unemployment benefit .as long as we pay Â£ 400 million to young people by create artificial job , there be no incentive for young people to find pay work .under my proposal they would run their own scheme .there would be no action committee or no bureaucracy .we would give young people the opportunity to do something for themselves .
