there be a differential in manufacturing efficiency between many United Kingdom manufacturer and their Continental counterpart .the differential in manufacturing cost for a small to medium - sized family saloon work out at about Â£ 350 .I doubt whether anyone would go to the continent , pay the deposit in advance and go through all the bureaucracy to import a car for such a low saving .nevertheless , that differential in manufacture efficiency exist .of course , our manufacturer be try to reduce that differential and to bring our performance up to Continental level .there have be great success with the Austin Metro , which already exceed Continental level .
