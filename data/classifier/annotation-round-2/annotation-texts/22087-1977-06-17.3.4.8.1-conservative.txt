no ; I believe that such a system would achieve very little .it would not reduce the number of separately mean - test benefit , it would not reduce the huge bureaucracy , and it would enshrine high income tax level .it would be difficult to put a tax credit system into operation without high income tax level .furthermore , such a system do not provide for the taxation of supplementary benefit .therefore , all those problem would still remain .I be anxious that we should not enter into this new system until we be sure that it would cure the problem to which I have allude .I be convinced that we need a much simple and more easily understand system , and I think that this could be achieve by implement the three or four proposal I have mention .
