in the private sector the position be much more serious .the average cost of a new house build in the private sector in Great Britain in the last quarter of 1967 be £ 4,350 , and land price be high here , partly because of the absence of the element of confiscation on acquisition and perhaps even more because of the damaging effect of the Land Commission Act .it be now reveal that the Land Commission be spend £ 12 for every £ 1 it collect .as that right - wing newspaper , the Sunday Mirror , say on 18th February : the creation of this expensive monument to bureaucracy be one of the few election promise the Labour Party have so far be able to keep .it be a pity .the figure I have be quote be of steep increase in price before devaluation , before the last swingeing dose of taxation , before the full effect of the Land Commission and the betterment levy , and before the further increase in interest rate on private borrowing and on mortgage .in an article on 23rd December , the Financial Times estimate that as a result of the tremendous financial pressure exert by the Government on the economy the basic cost of build a three - bedroom house might well show a national average rise of £ 350 during 1968 , of which £ 200 would be for increase land cost and £ 60 for increase finance charge and overhead .it be perhaps significant that only £ 22 would be due to increase cost of labour .those figure take no account of increase price after the Budget or the effect of the Transport Bill on haulage charge for build material .
