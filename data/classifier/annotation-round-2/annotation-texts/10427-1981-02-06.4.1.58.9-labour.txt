we have not yet hear from a Minister today , but I hope that Ministers will allow themselves to see the advantage that this Bill hold out for they .the irony of all this be that the most protect in Britain be not Ministers but civil servant , whose lack of productivity and efficiency , so we be always be tell , be such an obsession with the Prime Minister and her Ministers .one of the most noticeable concomitant of freedom of information abroad have be a galvanising of the bureaucracy , as the spotlight have be turn on its number and its method of operation .in Norway , for example — to quote again from the Dresner study — the new system lead to a different mentality , a different state of mind among civil servant .be that not what the Prime Minister want here ?I have always assume that that be so .
