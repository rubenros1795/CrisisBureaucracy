one wonder sometimes whether the mushroom growth of the Civil Service be not the Prime Minister 's secret weapon for deal with the unemployment problem .I repeat that if he really mean that he be back Britain there be a great deal that he himself can do .he can , for instance , drop some of the legislation that he have in mind for further nationalisation â€” steel and transport .these measure can only produce inefficiency , waste and extra expense .if he so desire he could cut bureaucracy to a minimum and restore more faith to free people willing to work and make profit not only for themselves but for the country .
