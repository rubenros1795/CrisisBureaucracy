I have consider the reorganisation of local authority very closely .it be only a year since it be introduce , so we can not be too critical .however , the point that concern I be that we seem to be reach a situation of less democracy in the new set - up .we be get , for want of a well term , a commissar - type of bureaucracy .we be get official decide policy and seem to run the whole show .this be due principally to the fact that there be now two - third few councillor in the United Kingdom than there be before reorganisation .People be become frustrate — otherwise there would not be so many ratepayer ' action group be set up — because there be few councillor to explain to ordinary citizen the problem associate with their locality , the reason why money be be spend and why the rate be so high .this matter of less democracy in local government should be of concern to all of we , irrespective of our political view .
