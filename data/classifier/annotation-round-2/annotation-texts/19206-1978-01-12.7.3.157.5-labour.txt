my fear be that proportional representation , of which ATV represent one type , will blur the issue .indeed , I believe that it be bind to blur they .what be more .I think that with proportional representation of this type will come a fragmentation of political representation and of political decision .if that happen , far from go to the people , power go away from they , because while the representative of the people be fragment the bureaucracy take over and the abominable grey man rather than the representative of the people rule .
