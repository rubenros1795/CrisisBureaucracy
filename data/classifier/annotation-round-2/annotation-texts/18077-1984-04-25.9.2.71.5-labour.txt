I mention early that I be concerned about future policy .the Government might listen to opinion in the House , since they have not find it convenient to express an opinion about the objection that have be raise to the proposal for the abolition of the metropolitan county .I shall quote here not my opinion , but the opinion of people who be in the business .in respond to the White Paper on transportation , the Automobile Association say : on road construction and maintenance … the Metropolitan County Councils have perform satisfactorily .it appear most unlikely that devolution will result in any benefit .the British Road Federation state : in many respect the Metropolitan Counties have improve upon the record of their predecessor highway authority .there be a danger that worthwhile scheme will be seriously delay by the transfer of power from six authority to 36 highway authority .the British Railways board — the Government have keep this quiet — state : devolution of structure plan to Districts will inevitably lead to an increasingly complex network of relationship .the pte will have to consider potentially divergent structure plan from up to 10 district council rather than from a single County Council .british Rail engineer will now be require to liaise with each individual district council over bridge work … this will inhibit the Board 's ability to reduce its staff .the National Waterways Transport Association state : the proposal … by remove the conurbation - wide overview of transport , will artificially fragment the local government element in transport planning .this function will be redistribute between interest whose view may well conflict , result in indecision , delay and increase bureaucracy .the Freight Transport Association state : the FTA believe that the Department of Transport consultation paper put too much reliance on the establishment of voluntary joint committee and simple voluntary co - operation between adjacent authority .all our experience tell we that such arrangement just do not work .the Public Transport User Group state : we have consider value for money , and support effort to reduce waste .we must be assure , however , that the abolition of the Metropolitan Councils and the GLC will save money .the White Paper do not give this assurance .indeed there be evidence that cost could increase .we can foresee that the proposal … will lead gradually to disintegration and a return to the confusion of the pre-1968 period .in the light of that evidence , I put it to hon .member who represent such conurbation that if the Government presume for one moment that it be right to pursue this policy and put aside all those objection and anxiety about their policy , they will rightly be charge with pursue a dogmatic policy that be so philosophically hidebound with the past that they can not envisage future need .the Government will try as well they can to win the day , but I put it to seriously dispose hon .member — not fetter by the straitjacket of the Department but think about the matter from their own experience — that it would be wise to take note of those comment .
