there be little remembrance that everyone of those people in the legal profession spend the time involve in go to Nottingham instead of Leicester would charge the estate with their fee .as I understand my hon .friend , this seem to have be completely lose sight of in all those discussion which go on in decide to reduce the number of office from 26 to 13 .the inconvenience for the general public appear not to have be consider .it be bureaucracy run wild , as usual with this Government , the thought be that this do not really matter because all the legal profession will get their fee and so do not mind whether they go from Nottingham to Leicester or from Leicester to Nottingham , because they will be able to charge the estate for that .no account seem to have be take of the very large problem , which be that the vast majority of the estate be small in value , and that the people concerned with they do not want to involve a solicitor with they , but want to settle matter deal directly with the Probate Office .under these proposal they will be put to very great disadvantage .that would be a sufficient argument for leave the situation as it be .
