in many way we be somewhat off the rail in discuss so - call bureaucracy .for example , many people have the idea that decentralisation be the answer to all our problem .my colleague who represent scottish constituency know that I do not want to see Scotland give self - government .I be interested in ensure that Scotland have a say here , in the British House of Commons .indeed , many of our fellow english hon .member need a Scots voice or two to guide they .I want to protect our right to be here and I do not want to be shunt off to anywhere else , not even the Scottish Grand Committee .I want our problem air right here .
