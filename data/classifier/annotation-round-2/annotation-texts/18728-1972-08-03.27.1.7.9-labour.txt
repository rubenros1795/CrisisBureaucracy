the EEC Bill will affect this Bill .I deal with that matter when we discuss the county committee and the need to have adequate advisory service whereby Ministers would be able to know what be happen in the industry .it be important that the consumer and those in the industry who contribute to the work and development of the industry should have their view know by the Minister and those who make decision .even though it be not in the Bill , and I appreciate I will be out of order if I develop it too far , inevitably loom over these matter be our entry into Europe .our decision could be take out of the hand of the House by the bureaucracy in Brussels .if I feel worried about that as a parliamentarian it be because I desire to protect british parliamentary tradition and , above all , to make sure that british farming be not harm by people outside this country .
