so we have an add tier of government and the expense of bureaucracy .yes , I may have have a hand in design the scheme for local government in Scotland .I think it right then and I do now .I do not condone for one moment either the establishment , or the shockingly high salary that have be attach to those in local government service , produce a bureaucracy under which all Scotland be smart and which have contribute in no mean measure to the increase in support for the SNP .it be unrealistic to suggest that we can demolish that system of local government so recently set up .we could do so only after a considerable length of time and at further great expense .
