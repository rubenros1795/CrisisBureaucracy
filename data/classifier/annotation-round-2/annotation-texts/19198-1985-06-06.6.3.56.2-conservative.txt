I support wage council .I hope that they will not be abolish and that we shall continue to give they a valuable role to play .however , there be a tremendous need for they to be reform .much of the bureaucracy that go with they be not acceptable to many small business .the value of wage council be not recognise , so they be not use and therefore they can not help the people whom they be there to protect .the most worthwile thing that we do be reform the council , streamline they , make they more efficient and reduce the bureaucracy while keep the basic regulation of protection for the ordinary work people .
