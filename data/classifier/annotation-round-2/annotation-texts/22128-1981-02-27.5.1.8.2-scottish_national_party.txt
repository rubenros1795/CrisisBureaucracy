"I suggest that there should be an agreement , which need not be couch in statute , between the board and the authority to allow the STB to undertake the projection of Scotland abroad .the Bill would enable that to happen and would give the Scottish Tourist Board a great leverage in its dealing with the BTA .there have be considerable concern in the Scottish Tourist Board in the past about what the present chairman have term the "" unmovable bureaucracy "" .I be judge this from statement by Mr. Devereux .the board seem to feel that the BTA be not responsive to the urging of the Scottish Tourist Board , and the remark I quote from Lord Mansfield early tend to bear that out ."
