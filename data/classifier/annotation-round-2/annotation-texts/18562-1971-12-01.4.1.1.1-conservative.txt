on a point of order .you will recall , Mr. Speaker , that several week ago I ask for your protection for the Sassenach majority in this House from the garrulous behaviour of the Scots .on every occasion that the Minister for the bureaucracy be set down to answer question at no .35 , he be not reach because the Scots occupy such an inordinate length of time with their question .will you now take step to protect the Sassenach majority and , by arrangement with the Leader of the House , see to it that the Minister for the bureaucracy be move so that he answer question begin at no .20 , so that at least once every six month hon .member may reach he ?
