the clause give the trade union a say in pricing policy .if they believe that the pricing policy be cast too low and that that stop they from earn a high wage , they will have a say at district , regional and national level in the pricing policy of the ship and in some of the commodity bring in for the manufacture of those ship .I can see the argument for that , but the clause could have be leave out .we could have stick to the original Bill and let the corporation get on with it instead of impose more bureaucracy .
