the Bill be also about job .the purpose of the Greater London enterprise board be not to provide an expensive bureaucracy but to put job on the ground .that be the Labour Party 's commitment in the GLC election manifesto on which we fight and win the election in 1981 .I must tell the hon .member for Ravensbourne ( Mr. Hunt ) , who have now leave the Chamber , that the Greater London enterprise board and the GLC have already begin to provide job in the Greater London area under exist power .they have do so in Haringey by provide workshop and they have a number of other scheme throughout London to provide a substantial number of job in the immediate future .that be how we should test the success or otherwise of the Greater London enterprise board .give that there eat 340,000 unemployed in Greater London , it be scandalous that attack should be make on a local authority that be seek to do its good to remove unemployment .
