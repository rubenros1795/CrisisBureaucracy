I be amazed to learn that local government be overstaffed .I always understand that it be understaffed , and that one of the reason why we be have an inquiry be to examine the need for large unit able to afford the necessary staff of the right calibre .what have be say about government by local authority and what be bureaucratic about it have nothing to do with staffing .it have something to do with the fact that councillor be part time .in the large local authority this mean that official be leave very much to themselves .this in in the nature of thing .I have often tell friend that 1 should have like to see an ombudsman for some large local authority before there be one for the Government service because there be far more check upon the Civil Service nationally than upon local government official .if there be a point about bureaucracy in local authority it be not so much in a wastage of manpower , because a great many of they can not afford the manpower that they should have , but rather in the administration , and that be what should be look at .
