I accept that what my hon .friend have suggest would be an improvement .I be worried that the amount of legislation and bureaucracy necessary to collect a relatively small sum would be disproportionate to the advantage .at the end of the first year there would need to be a follow - up and people would need to check .it would be too easy to take the collar off the dog and say that it no long belong to one and kick it out on to the street mile away from home .that be why I be worried about the hardship that the increase in the licence fee could bring to animal as well as the disproportionate cost of collect the money .we should put the responsibility for the behaviour and control of animal where it belong â€” on the owner .that be why I should like to see the penalty enforce more vigorously .
