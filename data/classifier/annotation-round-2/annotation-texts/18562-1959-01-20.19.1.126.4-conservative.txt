my right hon .friend the Member for Flint , West also make it quite clear in the remark he address to this particular aspect of the matter , when he say that the suggestion to cover a long period ahead be merely a matter of convenience .I be not concerned with the convenience of the bureaucracy or anybody else .I be concerned with the proper application and utilisation of capital resource which be exceedingly scarce .there be no great protagonist in the House of Commons or elsewhere than I be of the need for further and continue expansion of electricity resource for industrial production and productivity , for enlargement of farm output , for commercial purpose , and for labour saving , cleanliness and efficiency in the home .they be all very desirable purpose , but to provide the financial sinew for they be extremely expensive , as I demonstrate a few moment ago , and our primary concern ought to be the correct application of capital and its most efficient use .
