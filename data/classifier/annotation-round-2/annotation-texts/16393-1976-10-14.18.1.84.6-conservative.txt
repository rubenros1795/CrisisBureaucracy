it be utterly hideous in principle to set up a bureaucracy in order to establish a simple common law right for author .that be what I find offensive .that be what I hope the Opposition Front Bench will oppose tonight .we be establish a principle for author which have nothing whatever to do with the setting up of another extension of the bureaucracy â€” and at whose expense ?it will be at the expense of author who be so hard up that they can not buy bread , butter and Nescafe , who live in garret desperately try to write , and whose book go to the public library .they will have to pay the tax that support it , and so will all the pensioner , the unemployed and everyone else .
