I agree with my hon .friend the Member for Harrogate ( Mr. Banks ) about the uneconomic operation of the present licence system .I doubt whether increase the fee to £ 10 will solve the problem .we want owner to recognise their responsibility towards their pet of whatever specie — they do not have to be dog .I wonder whether increase the fee from the old 7 .6d .to £ 10 will achieve that .it will achieve only an increase in bureaucracy and a need for a department to catch those people who have not pay their £ 10 .I should prefer more enforcement of the law and penalty great than £ 10 .that would bring about a change of attitude in the owner of dog and other animal .they would start to take well care of their pet .I believe that an increase in the licence fee would produce the opposite of what we want to achieve .it will bring more hardship to dog .if dog can be badly treat and throw out on the street when the licence fee be the equivalent of only 7 .6d . , what will happen if it be raise to £ 10 ?I see more people be prepared to walk away lightly from their responsibility .
