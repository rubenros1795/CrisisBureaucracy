in my opinion , little of last substance have be create since direct rule to compare with those achievement of Stormont .what the Government have achieve — it be a remarkable record when we think about it and ponder over it — be the enormous burden of bureaucracy that oppress Ulster people .at the last count we have 109,000 public servant .the number be still rise .that be an achievement that the Minister responsible for the environment smile at .it may help employment in provide job for some people , but the money that it cost should be use to create far more job and more factory and to ensure that there be not too much reliance on the public sector .
