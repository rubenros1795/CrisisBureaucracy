as I have indicate , I want to deal with milk and milk marketing and some of the great uncertainty and query which remain in this vital part of the industry .when the Minister say that he want to free the agricultural industry from bureaucracy , bear in mind the bureaucracy of the Common Market in which we shall perhaps find ourselves shortly , one realise that he be in danger of again make himself a laugh stock in the industry .in Wales milk be the mainstay of the return to the industry , and that have not come about by accident .it have come about deliberately .during the war year one see the milk churn go high and high up the hill and farmer become more and more dependent on milk for their income .everyone know that once a farmer start to produce milk , once he start to be tie to a regular monthly milk cheque , it be exceedingly difficult for he , give the amount of resource available to the industry and the amount of acreage that be available , to get out of it .this part of the industry be genuinely concerned about what will happen to many important facet of the pricing arrangement for milk if we enter the Common Market .
