the main point of the debate , which be raise by the hon .Member for Hamilton concern the broad principle of the extent of Government assistance from the taxpayer to the ratepayer .both side of the House agree that the object of the exercise be to provide the good possible growth in service and to provide the most efficient service possible .it be a matter of nice judgment .it do not matter whether we pay as taxpayer or ratepayer , because they be really one and the same person .if the taxpayer pay too little , rate would go sky high and there would be too little central control .we can not afford to allow that to happen .if , on the other hand , the taxpayer pay too much , the local authority become mere cypher under the dictatorship of bureaucracy .I believe that we have strike the right balance .the degree of financial help which we be give by the order be about right , although I shall have a word or two to say about the present degree of central direction .
