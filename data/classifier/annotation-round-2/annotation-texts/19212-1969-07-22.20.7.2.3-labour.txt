these word be concern with the detail of day to day management .the Post Office will have a job to do and certain resource with which to do it .Post Office plant and facility be lay out in what it judge to be the good way to meet the prospective demand for they .but it be not superhuman , and conflict of priority for the use of its resource be bind to arise in individual case .if the Amendment stand , every single case of this kind will require the involvement of the Minister .thus , the Amendment will have the effect of put the Post Office 's customer into a bad position than at present because two body — the Ministry and the Post Office — will be involve , rather than one as now .it be hard to believe that this could lead to improved service or less red tape .in my view , it would lead to much more red tape and bureaucracy .
