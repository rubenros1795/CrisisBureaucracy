I know that with the present Government this be a particularly difficult problem .this be why I be so interested in the remark of the hon .Member for Fife , West .the theory of Socialism breed bureaucracy .in the end it become so powerful that it become their master .I be sure many hon .member opposite be aware of this problem .the proposal for an ombudsman go some way to meet this , but it do it on an individual plane and not on the wide one .we need to turn our attention to wide consideration .
