socialism always endeavour to support bureaucracy and nationalise industry .clearly , judge by those standard , this order find itself convict of be good socialism .the right hon .member for Battersea , North ( Mr. Jay ) have explain on more than one occasion that the philosophy of Socialism be that the man in Whitehall know good .the order would take away from local authority power which they have now to manage their own affair and vest power in an inspectorate which be control from Whitehall .personally , I disapprove of that .I believe that the power which have exist with the local authority ought to be leave with they .
