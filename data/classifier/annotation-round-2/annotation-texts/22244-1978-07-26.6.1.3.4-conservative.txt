secondly , we be very dubious about the proposal for the restructuring of the BBC .I hope that the right hon .Gentleman will reassure we on this point .we accept that some of the Annan committee 's criticism of bureaucracy and lack of control in the BBC may have be justify , but surely these could be well solve by the BBC governor and management themselves , as they be already seek to do .how can it make sense to overcome bureaucracy by increase it through the propose special management board ?be not these just a prolification of quango ?do it not threaten the basic independence of the BBC , which be so important in this country and throughout the world , if about half the member of these new body be to be appoint by the Home Secretary of the day instead of by order in Council , as be the position with the governor at present ?be it not very dangerous to increase the bureaucracy and , at the same time , appear to threaten the independence of the BBC ?
