I support the idea of a Scottish Development Fund .I shall vote against the Bill tonight , however , not because I do not think there be many excellent part in it but because in particular the fund that the Bill propose to disburse could very easily be disburse , without the extra bureaucracy , under the Industry Act 1972 among other measure .above all , I object to the former part of clause 2 which it be the stated intention of the Secretary of State to restore , which basically mean that the Scottish Development Agency would be capable by itself of carry on industrial undertaking .I oppose this as a totally unnecessary and damaging extension of State control .it be a damaging extension of State interference â€” capricious interference , in the language use by an hon .member on the other side of the House in Committee last week .the Secretary of State say that he would himself ultimately have control of the SDA .this be precisely what we fear .
