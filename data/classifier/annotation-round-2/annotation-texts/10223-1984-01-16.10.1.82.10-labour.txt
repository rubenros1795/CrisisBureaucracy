it be as foolish to argue that only the private sector be efficient as it be stupid to argue that the rof be beyond criticism .if one consider the submission of the union and the various report — include Mallabar and the Strathcona report of 1981 — it be clear that the rof can be improve .it be equally clear , however , that the base that exist be solid .the journal Military Technology point out : to some reader , the concept of government - own manufacturing facility may suggest inefficiency , soar cost and bungle bureaucracy … but what … be … find be a lean and hungry organisation which regard itself as the equal of any private venture manufacturer , and be prepared to fight for order in the highly commercialise marketplace — a philosophy which have see its export earning virtually quadruple since 1973 .the journal the Engineer say this year : now , the United Kingdom company … lead by the State - own Royal Ordnance Factories , have pull together an impressive arsenal of new manufacturing process and collaborative deal in the fight for survival .thus , we be not consider an ineffective and inefficient organisation that be a drain on national resource .it be clear from report and speech that its profit be impressive by the standard of british manufacturing concern , with record trading profit last year , a significant export market and great potential for export , all show the capacity of the rof to compete abroad .profit be reinveste and the rate of efficiency per employee have increase considerably .this be an efficient organisation and not a bottomless well drain national resource .the rof contribute to the public purse and , since the trading fund be establish , a public subsidy have never be seek .there be no drain on the PSBR and the whole organisation be efficient .it be , however , like any organisation , capable of reform .
