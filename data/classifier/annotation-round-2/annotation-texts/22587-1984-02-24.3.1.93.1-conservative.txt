the hon .Gentleman and I be colleague in the ILEA service and we both think highly of it .I be sure that he be not suggest that ILEA 's service be in danger from the Government 's proposal or that the service will not continue .provision for adult education be one of ILEA 's good feature .do the hon .gentleman agree that it be important that the high profile of adult education , which cost so much less per caput to provide than many other activity , should continue ?will he accept that since his day and mine in that service there have be a tremendous and unacceptable expansion of bureaucracy , notably within the inspectorate , each member of which have a secretary , an office , a personal assistant and all that go with that provision ?there be other area in which this have happen and there should be a tightening up of provision , which would be in the interest of the education service in London .
