last year 's debate be a hybrid occasion , because some of the report involve be the product of the previous PAC under the chairmanship of my right hon .friend the Member for Taunton ( Mr. du Cann ) .today , it be all the work of the right hon .Member for Heywood and Royton .nevertheless , it would be unfair , despite his fecundity , to measure the effectiveness of the Public Accounts Committee — the House 's most potent instrument for the restraint of waste and bureaucracy — simply by the volume of paper that it produce .its claim to a unique status within our parliamentary framework have always rest , on the quality rather than the quantity of its work .this time , the right hon .Gentleman and his colleague have give we both quality and quantity .I can think of several possible explanation for that .one be the right hon .Gentleman .another element be my hon Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe and his unique experience of work in the Public Accounts Committee under five different Chairmen .yet another reason be the contribution of all the member of the Committee .whatever else be the case , and whatever the attention give in the press to some of the other , new Select Committees , there be no doubt that the old Select Committee in the House be alive and well and show all the sign of be a growth industry .
