"for the most part , the hon .member for Kingston upon Hull , East ( Mr. Prescott ) make a good and thoughtful speech , but his party do not attach priority to the issue that matter most to he .he mention a plan for job and we must all welcome such plan from whatever source .but those who read "" Labour 's Programme 1982 "" will conclude that it be a plan for few job and perhaps none .the result of much of what be propose in that document would be a siege economy tightly control from Whitehall by Ministers and civil servant who be incompetent to make the necessary decision .the plan would produce a vast centralised bureaucracy that would do nothing to solve our main economic and industrial problem .the only additional job that it would create would be in the central planning bureaucracy ."
