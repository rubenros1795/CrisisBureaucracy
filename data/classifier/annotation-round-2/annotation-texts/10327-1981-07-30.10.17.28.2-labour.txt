secondly , we may have to consider — this be along the line of new clause 7 — a system of planning permission for the countryside .if one can not erect a carport at one 's home without permission , it be arguable that the same criterion should apply to the destruction of hedgerow , downland , roughland , pond , stream and wetland .I fully acknowledge — this be one of the reason why I hope that the function of the Bill will avoid what I be suggest — that this mean an extension of bureaucracy .I do not like bureaucracy , but if such a system be to be introduce , a general development order would have to be introduce for de minimis case .
