much of the debate have concern the balance between the demand and supply side of the economy .the big single enginering and capital good project available to this country be the construction of the North Sea gas gathering line .I greatly regret that , due to bureaucracy and indecision , it will no long be possible to start work on that project until well into 1984 or even later .I make that point very simply because that demand could and should be inject into the economy and would cost the public purse nothing .
