as be well say by my hon .friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras , South ( Mr. Dobson ) , the House be concern with the administration of justice and with injustice .he mention the Tolpuddle martyr and the injustice to poor people who do not have a vote and who have very few right in the eighteenth century .the injustice in the late twentieth century be as real , but be of a different nature .I hope that the House will pay attention to the injustice clone to Mr. Edward Myer of Dalton in Huddersfield .the cause be the complex bureaucracy that we set up by statute to run our affair .
