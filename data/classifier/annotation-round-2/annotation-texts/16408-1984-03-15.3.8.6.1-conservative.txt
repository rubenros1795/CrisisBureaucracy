I do not believe that the use of private practitioner be a possible alternative to the exist arrangement or the new arrangement propose in the White Paper .we be talk not about a vast new bureaucracy but about staff cost of advocacy under an independent prosecute service , which will be about £ 3·2 million low than at present .it remain to be see exactly how we organise the service .it will be of benefit to do what the Royal Commission recommend and have an independent prosecution service .
