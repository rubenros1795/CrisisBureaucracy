I do not think we can afford to wait for the Report of the Royal Commission and any subsequent legislation in order to make a start .such delegation must be both real and effective .nothing be achieve by the proliferation under this Government of advisory committee such as the regional economic planning council .they be just the creature of Whitehall and manifestly impotent .that be clearly demonstrate by the South - Eastern Economic Planning Council over the whole wretched stansted affair .the stansted affair be one of the bad example in modern time of a bureaucracy run mad .
