anyone who study modern business and the progressive , industrial commercial firm know that they put an increase premium on knowledge .they be look for the educate man , and the educate man be an individual who be not afraid to stand up for his view .it be an interesting concept that side by side with the expansion of our university population and the expansion , as I believe , of rational man there be a grow need in industry and commerce for the sort of man or woman who come from our university .it be this aspect of modern society which too often go unnoticed and be not emphasise .I can well believe that there be individual in the student population who wish to encourage the opposite point of view â€” that they be grow up in a society in which they will find themselves increasingly manage , if not by a State bureaucracy , then by private monopoly .
