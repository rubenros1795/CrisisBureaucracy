enforcement power certainly need to be strengthen .in principle , I support the provision put forward in the Bill .I be not in favour of bureaucracy .all government should reduce it to a minimum .however , there be a case for a simple form of registration by the video retailer .I be not suggest an elaborate licensing system , but there be a good case for have a simple form of notification of trading activity with the local authority .an even strong case can be make for video retail outlet keep record of the source of their cassette .I be not sure whether the right hon .member for Bournemouth , West intend to do so , but he seem to absolve retailer from full responsibility for what have be happen .we must not do that .they be not naive ; they know their job pretty well .if put to the test , they know whether they be deal with pirate film .therefore , they must have responsibility for ensure that the law be properly enforce .
