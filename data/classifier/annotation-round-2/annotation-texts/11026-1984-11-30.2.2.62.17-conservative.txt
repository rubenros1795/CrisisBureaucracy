I know that the Government have take it upon themselves as a major policy task to review unnecessary restriction , red tape and bureaucracy .apart from look at other area such as the shop legislation , our licensing law need to be look at urgently because of the sense of injustice and frustration that be feel not one by customer but by those who need to operate within the law and to apply to the court for extension from time to time .the law be not satisfactory , and I hope that the Government will give some commitment to review it at the early possible opportunity .
