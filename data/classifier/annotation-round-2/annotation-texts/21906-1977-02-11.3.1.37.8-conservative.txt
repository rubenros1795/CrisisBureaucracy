I receive a letter this week from a constituent say that she have difficulty get her child to school and that other resident in the area have the same difficulty .apparently there be a municipal bus which come so far and no far because some other municipal road transport concession have be give to another bus company .a private bus can not pick up her friend and relation because of the restriction on its licence .there be another transport restriction for another school bus which do not allow it to pick up child from another area .therefore , although there be a number of bus with empty seat go to and from this fringe part of the town into the centre where the school be , nothing can be do .that be pure red tape .it be bureaucracy go mad .
