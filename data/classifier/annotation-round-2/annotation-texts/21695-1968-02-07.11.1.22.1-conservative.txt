the hon .member for Birmingham , Perry Barr ( Mr. Christopher Price ) make an extremely important point about the staffing of further education department .I hope that the Minister of State have take careful note of it .I have no doubt that until local authority and Government Departments react in the way describe by the hon .gentleman as necessary , and in the same way as any successful business organisation would react to a change in its set - up , there be bind to be a growth of the bureaucracy .but if local authority and Government Departments can be persuade to react in the way that they should , I have no doubt that the growth of bureaucracy can be control or , well still , that reduction in it can be secure .
