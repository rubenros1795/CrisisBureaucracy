I regret , however , that there be no mention in the gracious Speech of the problem of Welsh administration .in this respect there be two error to avoid .the first error be that of the divorce of Ministers from their Departmental responsibility , and the second be that of add needlessly to the cost of bureaucracy .the Advisory Council for Wales and Monmouthshire be obsess with status .it could not get out of its head the suspicion that Scotland might he have something that Wales be not have .when the problem of administration as regard Wales or any other country be discuss we often tend to overlook altogether the impact of proposal for administrative reform on the life of the ordinary people who will suffer under the administration or benefit under it ; and that should be the acid test .
