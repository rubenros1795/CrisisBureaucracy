it be argue that an Assembly would lead to too much bureaucracy , but , as the unemployed in Cardiff know , 1,100 job would have be create by the Assembly .we do not hear much about bureaucracy in the run - up to the european election .the European Parliament create an extra tier of Government and only 33 per cent .of the people vote for member of that Assembly , but the Government go ahead with it .there be a duality of standard between what be acceptable for Wales and what be acceptable in more favour arena .
