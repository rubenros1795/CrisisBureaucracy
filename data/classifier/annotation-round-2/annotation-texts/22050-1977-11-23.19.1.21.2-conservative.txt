I can not understand , first , why the Government propose it , because I remember the speech of the right hon .gentleman the Secretary of State for Energy at his party conference when he rail against the monopoly in this country and say that they be the cause of our economic decline .I can not understand why my right hon .friend the Member for Yeovil ( Mr. Peyton ) , who make his point about the monopoly , be so hesitant about express his view in the Lobby against the monopoly which be propose here .I know that it be not a perfect monopoly .I know that the hon .member for Londonderry ( Mr. Ross ) say that some private breeder can select their own semen and their own bull , but the economic involve and the weight of the licensing arrangement and bureaucracy be unlikely to allow full freedom to develop .the House be excuse itself from ask question and ask for assurance , have be buy off by the promise of a review .
