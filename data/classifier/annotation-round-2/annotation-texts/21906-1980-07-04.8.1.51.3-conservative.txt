"we all know what it be like .in Burton on Trent we use to have a good town clerk .then he become the chief executive and have a deputy .it be not long before it be necessary to have a public relation officer to explain what these two be do .then , it be not very long — but fortunately my district council be too sensible to fall for this — before a plan emerge from out of the inner recess of the East Staffordshire District council which claim "" it be unfair to load the public relation officer with all these burden .he be do wonderful work , but he need a deputy . ""so bureaucracy proliferate .it feed upon itself .when it be say "" all we need be one man in Stafford to do the work "" , it will be see clearly as nonsense by people in Burton , Lichfield , Tamworth and all the other town in my county when they realise that they have not get the provision that be lay down in the Bill ."
