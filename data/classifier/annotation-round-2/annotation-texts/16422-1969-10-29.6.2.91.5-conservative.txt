have the Government no intention at deal with the present bloated bureaucracy ?this be the second point which I mention when I be refer to the problem which be completely ignore in the gracious Speech .I understand that there be 70,000 more civil servant than there be in 1964 .we be often tell by Government spokesman that all these people be do very useful work and that many people have be recruit to ensure that the work of the Supplementary Benefits Commission can be carry out in a proper and humane fashion .but this growth in the number of civil servant have also be due to the introduction of , for instance , selective employment tax , which I understand have lead to the recruitment of about 1,000 more civil servant .it be due to the introduction of new taxis like the capital gain tax and corporation tax .it be due to the recruitment of about 160 public relation officer .it be a reflection on the Government that in order to convince the people that they be do any good they must employ no few than 160 mare public relation officer than the Conservative Administration employ .one wonder who they be try to fool .
