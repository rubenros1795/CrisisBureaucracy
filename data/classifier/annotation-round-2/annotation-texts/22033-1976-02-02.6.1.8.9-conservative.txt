very little land be come forward in white land form from landowner .for example , a developer tell I only today — he be not talk wholly in jest — about a site that be withdraw nom the market in his area partly because the owner have decide to grow potato on it instead .I have always say that the effect of so high a rate of tax with penal power of acquisition will mean that the Minister 's land scheme will work only through massive compulsory purchase , with all that that mean in term of slowness , bureaucracy and damage to the house building programme .
