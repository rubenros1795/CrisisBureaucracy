in this modern world , there be great talk of devolution , of more responsibility be place on individual .this be a very important political matter .it be a wide matter which we could discuss at great length .I shall not pursue it too far .however , if we be to have partnership with industry and if we be to enable our ordinary citizen to feel that they be part of government , we must create a body of the kind we propose .there be a great danger that Britain will be subject to decision of a bureaucracy without adequate parliamentary scrutiny or check .it be reasonable that in the Bill some machinery should be create which would enable the House of Commons and industry connect with agriculture and food to have their say and convey their view adequately to our Minister , who , after all , will be on the Council of Ministers and here , too , will be responsible for the new policy which will emerge in Europe .
