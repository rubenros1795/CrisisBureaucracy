the help for voluntary group and project that be trumpet forth from county hall amount , on the figure we have , to no less than Â£ 500,000 .I certainly would not criticise individual grant , as the hon .Gentleman appear to ask I to do .they be mostly small grant , but they appear to be highly selective .they appear to be dot around the London borough on the scattergun technique .our criticism would be that such grant be a strange use of the fund and power of a county council .help small club and scheme be surely a matter for the borough concern .they have the necessary local knowledge .my criticism be that the GLC be highly selective and do not genuinely help all sport in our capital city .that be the change that we seek ; we see no need for a massive bureaucracy such as the GLC to assist sport in minor way by a few small grant .the borough should do it .that be our policy .they have the knowledge .
