may I draw my hon .friend 's attention to two recent example of behaviour by the community relation council ?be he aware of the violent and offensive attack by the Northampton community relation council on my hon .friend the Member for Northampton , North ( Mr. Marlow)â€”an attack which would be proper in a political party but which be grossly improper in a non - political bureaucracy ?secondly , be my hon .friend aware of the refusal by the Wolverhampton community relation council to accept the advice of the Commission for Racial Equality on the appointment of an official ?do not those two example point to the proposition that the community relation council should be directly responsible either to the Home Office or to local authority ?
