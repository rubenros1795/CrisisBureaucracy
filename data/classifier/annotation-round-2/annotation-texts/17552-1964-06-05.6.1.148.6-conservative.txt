my own view of what would happen be that the idea of be face by this sort of complication , and this vast bureacracy of the land commission decide what sort of term lease should have , whether or not they should be assign , and so on , would be so restrictive that it would drive more and more people to bid for the old freehold house that exist , thus have the reverse effect of that which hon .member opposite want , by push up the price of exist property .there would be a rig market for the new form of leasehold property , but the old type of freehold property would be bid for to a much great extent by people who do not want to be restrict by the bureaucracy envisage in the land commission .
