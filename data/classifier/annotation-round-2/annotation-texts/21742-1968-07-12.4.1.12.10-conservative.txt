if there be to be , as I be sure there must be , some streamlining of the labour force in the work , it be imperative to prevent the growth of bureaucracy at the centre .there be a few disturbing indication of the growth or size of the central body , and this be something which should be watch very carefully because we all know the bad effect on morale of growth at the centre while there be pressure for contraction in number of man on the job .I hope that we shall hear more about this in the next report of the Corporation .
