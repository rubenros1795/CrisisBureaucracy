"my fifth , and a particularly important , point be to ask my hon .friend whether he can reassure the community that the Government recognise the tremendous merit of independence for the sailing and boat fraternity and no not visualise any form of compulsory registration or numbering of the boat or anything similar .that would be disastrous .the bureaucracy would be frightening to contemplate .in an increasingly regimented society , I believe that just "" mess about in boat "" be a fundamental freedom .bit of paper will not make the sea a safe place .what we be ask the Government for be paternalism in a wide sense and not regimentation in any sense ."
