the one part of the Secretary of State 's speech with which I agree be that one reason for the current problem be the introduction of direct billing .even during the six year that the Labour Government be attack for their policy , but do their good to defend the water industry , conservative Members do not explain to their electorate that direct billing include both the supply of water and the disposal of sewage .that should have be meet with compensate reduction from local authority that no long have to provide for sewage and drainage .no doubt conservative member do not make that point because most local authority be under conservative control at that time .I feel that I have to draw attention to that deception .nor do conservative member investigate the cost of bureaucracy , although the Minister try to do so today .
