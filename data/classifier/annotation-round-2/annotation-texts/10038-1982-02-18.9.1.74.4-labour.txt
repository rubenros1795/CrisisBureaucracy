when I talk to patient about bureaucracy in the Health Service , the one matter about which they be all upset be the time at which they be wake up in the morning .they find it amazingly bureaucratic that they must be wake up in the last hour of the night shift .the nurse have be there all night , but they be expect to work hard in the last hour of the shift get patient up at a time when most people wish to have another hour 's sleep .the patient be awaken much too early because of the bureaucracy that have develop and the way in which hospital seem to be run for the benefit of the consultant , not for anyone else who work there or for the patient .it be sad that nothing in the order suggest that the new authority will do anything to ensure that patient be give some consideration .
