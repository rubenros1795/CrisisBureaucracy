there be , as have be say , a further addition to bureaucracy .indeed , one be remind of Circulars 30/75 and 171/74 .paragraph 8 of the latter state : it be an essential feature of the rate support grant settlement for 1975–76 that local authority should provide for no expansion in present total staff number .yet we already know , on an optimistic estimate , that an extra 14,000 staff will be require for this little Bill .we have hear from the right hon .gentleman this afternoon that the cost be to be at least £ 1 million a day but that none of this will fall on the ratepayer .I say to the Secretary of State for Wales that he may not control the rate support grant for England but we shall come back to the Government if one penny come upon the ratepayer of this country from this Bill , if it ever get on the statute book .
