my second and more major reservation arise over the power to look into the business of the nationalise industry .the thrust of Government policy have be to ensure that nationalise industry become more efficient , manage themselves well and act in as commercial a way as possible .I be convince that the provision of the Bill will move we in the opposite direction .the Bill seek to impose power and investigatory method that may or may not be suit for a bureaucracy , but be certainly not suit for commercial undertaking .
