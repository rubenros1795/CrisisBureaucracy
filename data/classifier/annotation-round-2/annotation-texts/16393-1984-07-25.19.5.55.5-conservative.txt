"frankly , I be against quango and bureaucracy .a passage in this abominable and conceited report seem to demonstrate the fact that , whatever else the Minister do , he must not increase the power of the CAA â€” the Civil Airports Authority , the Civil Airlines Authority , the Civil Aviation Authority , or whatever it be .I hate initial .the fact that one do not know the word for which they stand show that they be a trap .if ever there be a warning to a democracy , it be surely the relevant word of Gibbon , which the report quote and which could never be well use than against the CAA .the report quote Gibbon as write that the spirit of monopolist be narrow , lazy and oppressive : their work be more costly and less productive than that of independent artist ; and the new improvement so eagerly grasp by the competition of freedom , be admit with slow and sullen reluctance in those proud corporation , above the fear of a rival , and below the confession of an error "" .if ever there be a description of the CAA 's report , it be contain in those word ."
