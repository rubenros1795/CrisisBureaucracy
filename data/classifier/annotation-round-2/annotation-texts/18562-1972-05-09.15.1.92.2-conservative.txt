I now propose to say something about the allegation that VAT will create an enormous fiscal bureaucracy both in Government Departments and in industry , trade and commerce .that be possibly true at the time of Richardson and his report , but it be not true today .every workshop , every office and every account department of every firm of any size have calculate machinery readily available .the fact that VAT be calculate on each invoice be of no consequence at all give adequate electronic and other type of office machinery to deal with it .
