for far too long the dead hand of the Ministry of Finance in Northern Ireland have squash initiative from the Civil Service and the Departments .I be glad that the Finance Corporation will not be subject to control by the Ministry of Finance more than be absolutely necessary .Mr. Charles Villiers , the first chairman , would be well advise to clear the deck by have his tussle with the Ministry of Finance at the beginning .he should get the guideline agree well in advance , otherwise he will face endless , irritate , penny pinching interference by the non - expert of the Treasury , who will want to poke their nose into everything that he and his director on the board do .the Finance Corporation be too important a proposal for the prosperity of Ulster to be decimate by bureaucracy .
