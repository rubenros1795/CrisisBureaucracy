I wonder what be the object of the idea that Lloyd 's specification do not matter all that much .be it the object of the steel authority to try to secure bulk order and standard plate ?I feel that a certain amount of bureaucracy creep in here , and I hope that the right hon .Gentleman will tackle the Minister of Power about this very important matter .now the steel industry be nationalise , I see no reason why the special need of shipbuilding , which be very much in the national interest , should not be regard and why this section of the Geddes Report should not be implement .as the hon .Member for Sunderland , South say , we be not out of the wood , and I think that this be one of the most important way in which we be not out of the wood .so I beg the right hon .gentleman to take these negotiation about steel price very seriously .
