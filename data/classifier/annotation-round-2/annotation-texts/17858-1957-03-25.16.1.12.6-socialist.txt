I could quote many instance of people protest against this decision , but I want to quote only two more .one be the summing up in an article in the British Medical Journal , last month in a letter sign by four distinguished member of the profession in Edinburgh .it be sign by two .one be Dr. T. R. R. Todd , an eminent Edinburgh physician whom I know in a professional capacity since I spend four month in his ward .I be grateful for his medical knowledge and skill , and that of Dr. Halliday Croom , and Mr. W. A. D. Adamson the surgeon .one other signatory to the letter be that world famous surgeon , Professor Norman Dott .they say : it would appear from this wide and forceful public reaction that where we have a regional hospital board out of touch with medical and lie opinion , and under - estimate the valuable part play by small hospital in the medical service .surely no State bureaucracy should assert its authority against the express wish of the people by whom the National Health Service be finance and for whom the National Health Service exist .that sum up in a nutshell the case for the Secretary of State give way on this issue .
