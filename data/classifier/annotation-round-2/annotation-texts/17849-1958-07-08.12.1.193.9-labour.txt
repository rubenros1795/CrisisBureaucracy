I have always believe that there be two condition for the survival of democracy .the first be a clash of opinion of man of good will , and the second be the constant challenge to bureaucracy .however , the challenge to bureaucracy can not reasonably be extend to the abuse or even the use of Privilege which would inflict unjustified injury on those who be serve the House or who be in the employment of the State .
