this unfortunate boy 's case cry out for compassionate treatment .I trust that my appeal on his behalf will arouse more than word of sympathy from the Government .that I can bring Timothy 's case before the High Court of Parliament should provide some comfort to those people who , like myself , feel frustrated by the restriction of this House and anger by the heavy hand of bureaucracy which have fall on Northern Ireland with direct rule .
