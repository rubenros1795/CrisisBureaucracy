my one criticism — and not of the party opposite in what I be about to say — be that in recent year in particular there have be in some area of local government a big increase in the ratio between chief and Indians — or , perhaps well , between tooth and tail — between those engage in administration and those at the sharp end provide help for those in need , and so on .this ratio , the administrative overload , in the word of a famous Resolution of this House of 1780 , have increase , be increase , and ought to be diminish .but the big single factor in this wide area of our national life , extend from local government to water supply and the Health Service — I say this to anyone who talk about the increase in public expenditure — be in the drastically misconceive policy which lead to the re - organisation carry through in local government — duplication , double banking , a vastly increase bureaucracy , super - chief take on to supervise exist chief , and divide responsibility .let those whose single prescription for handle our nation 's problem lie in vague proscription of public expenditure examine their own record , their own responsibility , their own conscience — on water , on the Health Service and on local government .
