a nil registration limit for the construction industry would be a draconian measure with a vengeance .it would catch every odd job man who supplement his earning by occasional evening or weekend work .it would have to be enforce .if such people be successfully register they would have to be control and their vat return and remittance would have to be investigate .the flurry of correspondence to hon .member complain about the bureaucracy , rule and form - filling would be alarming .
