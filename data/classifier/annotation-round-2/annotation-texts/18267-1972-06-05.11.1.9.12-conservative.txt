there be wide acceptance of the view that once the levy / grant have have a permanent impact it should be run down to get rid of the paper work and bureaucracy which be inevitable in its present form .let I emphasise that in put forward these two part of the argument we have reach no firm decision .I be aware of the deeply hold view in some quarter that in some industry the levy / grant system should remain for a long period .we do not underestimate the system 's inherent difficulty and disadvantage which have lead both to the move by some board to phase it out and to the proposal to end it after 1972â€“73 .we shall be consider the whole question again most carefully before reach a decision .
