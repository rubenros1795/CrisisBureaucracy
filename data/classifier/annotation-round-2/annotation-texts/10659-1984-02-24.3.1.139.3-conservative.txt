as someone who have serve as a London borough councillor , a GLC member , a London Member of Parliament and a Minister at the Department of the Environment , I hope that I be in a good position to look at this issue in a broad perspective .I must tell the House that there be life after the GLC .not only be it not the case that London will collapse like a pack of card when the GLC be abolish , but there be positive benefit and advantage to be secure from abolition .it will lift a burden of unnecessary bureaucracy off the shoulder of Londoners and they will feel the benefit in their pocket when the result be rate low than would otherwise have be the case .they will be well able to exercise close democratic control over the service that will be run by their local , accessible town hall , and not from the remoteness of County Hall .
