finally , the letter state : ( iv ) it will now be virtually impossible for optician to tell a patient what their NHS charge will be ( as between £ 7–40 and £ 30–00 ) until an examination have be complete and their prescription determine .it be almost as if bureaucracy run wild when the Government seek to make such change .the spin - off of increase cost never seem to be consider .the problem in the dental service be that a person be not inform whether he will receive treatment on the NHS or will have to pay privately .I quote a case in the Midlands , where there be only two dentist who be prepared to give NHS service .all the other dentist give only private service .
