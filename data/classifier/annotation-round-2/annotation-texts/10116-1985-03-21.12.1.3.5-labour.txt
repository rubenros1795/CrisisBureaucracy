another challenge for the British Government be to speed up the present lumber bureaucracy that make EEC food aid so slow to reach famine victim .it be only after the public start scream that Europe 's bulge grain store split a little of its surplus in the direction of starve Africa .the public again show imagination and compassion when they generously give about £ 40 million to Ethiopia , compare with £ 26 million from the Government .if we be not careful , Ethiopia might be the beginning rather than the end , for it happen in spite of all the warning that be give , not least in this House .
