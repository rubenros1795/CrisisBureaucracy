as my hon .friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury ( Mr. Ridley ) say , we should be reduce simply to the r√¥le of fetch and carry our own domestic requirement .the Minister 's answer to this be simply to meddle with the structure of our transport industry , give it a central control and impose a new bureaucracy upon it , forget that the great development and progress in our port have be of a civic nature .I be not say that this be the only method of improve the industry , but there be nothing to commend nationalisation of the port system .
