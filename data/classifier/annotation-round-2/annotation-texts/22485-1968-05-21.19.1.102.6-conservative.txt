there be no doubt that the whole of this Bill be anti - workman , anti - trade union , anti - industrialist , anti - free - enterprise .it be a take - over bid to put in , instead of our present parliamentary democracy , the rule of socialist bureaucracy .I believe that it be doom to failure and can only result in further measure of repression when the present measure come to an end .in 18 month , or whatever it be , a new Bill will be present because , if this Bill have not be satisfactory in provide the mean or reach the end which the Government want , it will have to be extend .if it be successful , surely the result will be : let we reinforce success , let we have another Bill and continue on the same line as we have be work on .
