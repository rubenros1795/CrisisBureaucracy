what have be the attitude of Mr. and Mrs. Brunton during the whole month that this case have be discuss ?it be simply that we be seek for a re - inspection , and that , I believe , be a perfectly reasonable and fair request to make .I realise we be not deal with evil people do evil thing , but I be convinced that we be deal with people who have make a mistake , and I would say that the continual refusal of the Ministry to re - inspect these premise really be not good enough because what it really amount to , in my humble opinion , be , the right of ordinary people and the right of people 's properly elect Member of Parliament must pay homage to the infallibility of bureaucracy , and that I refuse to do .there be nothing in the Act of 1957 which deny the Executive the right to re - inspect if they choose to do so .it may be say that there be nothing in the Act which require they specifically to do so , but there be nothing which say they may not , and I would say the Executive should exert their proper authority in this respect .
