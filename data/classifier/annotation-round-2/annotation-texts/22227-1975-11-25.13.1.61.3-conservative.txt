can the Government 's policy succeed ?it be obvious that we shall have more civil servant and more bureaucracy .there be the continuous cosseting of State enterprise and less understanding on the Government Back Benches of the profit motive .the profit motive apply not only to business , but to every person in this country , whether he be in business or sell his labour .the profit motive should be encourage .More help should be give to the private sector .again I ask whether the Government 's policy can succeed .I should think the answer be anything but satisfactory .
