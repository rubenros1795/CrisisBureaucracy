when the matter go to the Department of the Environment , I be not honour by a personal letter from the Secretary of State .I get a letter from the Under - Secretary .the Department be split into little pocket , and I make no complaint about that .but this be a serious matter .the Under - Secretary of State for the Environment , bring face to face with this problem — not directly through I but indirectly through the Department of Education and Science — be shunt it over the counter to another Department .he say : we do appreciate that there be a problem here , but because of the further issue which arise on this particular boundary , I really do think that on balance it would be much more satisfactory to leave this over for the Boundary Commission 's detailed review and to make arrangement meanwhile .the hon .Gentleman continue : but there will be no reason why the new school should not vest in the metropolitan district from the start , if be catchment area be so overwhelmingly in that district .thus it would be possible for the school to be the property of the metropolitan district , and be administer by they , from the outset , even though the actual boundary between the two county be not adjust until a little later .I hope that this consideration will allay the fear feel locally , and will enable you to withdraw your amendment .that be quite a courteous approach to I , but I do not accept it .why should I withdraw the Amendment and accept a pig in a poke from any Government Department ?as a Member of Parliament , I have live with Government Departments for 22 year , under government of both political complexion , and often I be extremely sceptical of they .on a matter such as this , they have a technique for always dodge a difficult column .it be nothing to do with party politic .it be to do with the nature of bureaucracy .
