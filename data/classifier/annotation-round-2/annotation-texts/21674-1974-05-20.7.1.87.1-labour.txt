I should like first to put on record , for the sake of at least one Conservative Member , that the Greater London Council be very much control by Cutler and company , under Tory domination , between 1967 and 1973 .therefore , when we hear account of event which take place in 1972 , when there must have be preparatory work before that , when we hear accusation of bad management and bureaucracy , when we hear of a shortage of surveyor , as one of the argument to try to justify not proceed with the GLC 's municipalisation programme , let it be understand that the Labour - control GLC have be in office for only a little more than one year .it can not be argue , in all fairness , that all the problem be a result of the policy that the present administration at County Hall be pursue .
