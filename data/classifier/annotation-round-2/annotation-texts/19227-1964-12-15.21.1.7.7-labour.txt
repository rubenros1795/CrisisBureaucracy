the hon .and gallant Member have complain that the handling of the case be characterise by , let we say , excessive bureaucracy and some muddle , perhaps , which involve time , expense and so on .in so far as this be not a reflection of Mr. Smith 's dissatisfaction with the result express itself as a criticism of the procedure , I presume it arise from the considerable correspondence which have be entail and the slow pace of event .Mr. Smith , admittedly , have to write many letter — we admit this — but the procedure require that both party should , before the matter reach the Service Committee , be entitle to state their own case and to comment on that put forward by the other party .the same procedure apply broadly on any appeal to the Minister from the decision of the Service Committee and Executive Council .this may take a certain amount of time — it do — but I be sure that the hon .and gallant Gentleman would agree with I that , regulation apart , no other method of proceeding would accord with the requirement of natural justice .both side have to know what the other have say .
