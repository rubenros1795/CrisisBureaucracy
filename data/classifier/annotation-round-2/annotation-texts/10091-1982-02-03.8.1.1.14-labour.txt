leave the Common Market would give we the opportunity to re - establish trading and other link with our former partner in the European Free Trade Association and our fellow member of the Commonwealth .we would retain the opportunity to participate in other international forum such as the Council of Europe , OECD , the Commonwealth and the United Nations .if we throw off the shackle of Brussels bureaucracy once and for all we would not diminish but enhance our opportunity to build up wider and well international relation with the rest of the world .therefore , I ask the House to support my Bill .
