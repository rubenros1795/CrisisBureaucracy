it have be an important part of the British Constitution for many year that we appoint non - expert Ministers , who be elect member of the House , to head Ministries .this be open to criticism .but if we have lie Ministers at the top of administrative Departments , they be in a position to bring a little humanity to bureaucracy and to protect the individual from over - efficient administration .I believe that that be one of the most important part of the british constitution .this be perhaps more important in the case of technical Ministers ; and the Post Office be become a technical Department .it be essential that the lay Ministers at the head of technical Departments should protect the public from too much technology and temper the wind of technology with a little humanity .
