I want to give the Minister every chance to deal with the anger and sarcasm of his own supporter .they certainly throw up a large number of prickly point for he to deal with .I hope that he will give particular attention to the scottish situation , particularly the financial implication .the scheme be not cost - effective .it be of marginal relevance to the running of an efficient planning system and it be counter - productive in the sense that it have build - in waste and bureaucracy of a kind that no one want .
