the next not unimportant point raise by the hon .member for Poplar be the question of paper work .I agree with he .paper work be the most significant form of grit in the modern commercial machine .the International Chamber of Commerce at its recent meeting in Turkey set up several committee to deal with this , and these have produce a number of interesting report .a very considerable effort be be make by large number of organisation , private , governmental and international , to deal with this question , which it be a concentration of all the fiery heat of bureaucracy of all kind in one great overwhelming burden on commerce .we know that the matter be extremely difficult to put right and I would remind the hon .member for Poplar that two of the most serious and time - comsume form of paper work which international commerce have to bear be those impose by Customs and Government .therefore the obligation , which he have rightly describe as fall everywhere , fall equally on the public sector .
