the duty of the pragmatist be to find out where public opinion be go .do public opinion require a deviation from what the former Chancellor of the Exchequer in his heart must know — and the present Chancellor advocate — be sound economic policy ?should the Chancellor deviate from they for reason of public opinion ?it be a matter of judgment .in my judgment , the Government be not ahead of public opinion and , if anything , I suspect that they be a little behind public opinion .I think that there would be support for even great cut , particularly in the bureaucracy — central and local .it have grow by 40 per cent .since 1972 .as far as I can judge , it have not give we anything like a 40 per cent .improvement in service as a result .
