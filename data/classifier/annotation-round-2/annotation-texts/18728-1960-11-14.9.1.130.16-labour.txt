like other hon .member , I have be send a memorandum prepare by the secretary of the River Boards ' Association .in Cumberland , the river board estimate that its income will be £ 9,420 .the cost of prepare the charge roll will be £ 1,550 .it be estimate that the annual cost of collection will be £ 1,950 .in other word , the amount available for land drainage work will be £ 7,470 .perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to give we an effective reply to this question , because it would be very wrong if there be create in any drainage area a bureaucracy for the collection of rate .the right hon .member for Thirsk and Malton have already state that they should be engineer rather than rate collector or debt collector .
