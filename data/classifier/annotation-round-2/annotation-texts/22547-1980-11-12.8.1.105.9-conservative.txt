a further point which have not be touch on previously this evening be the assumption that efficiency will somehow be bring about by spend more money on a big bureaucracy , whether it be for a major party , such as that of the present Government , or a small party .I do not accept that spend more money mean that one will be more efficient and effective .I have hear no case put forward to suggest that opposition have become more effective since these proposal originate in 1975 .
