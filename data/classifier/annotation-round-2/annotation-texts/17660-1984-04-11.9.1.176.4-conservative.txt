the hon .member for Copeland ( Dr. Cunningham ) try to convey the impression that we be somehow deny local democracy and about 18 million people be be frustrate by the Bill , but it be a farce to suppose that the metropolitan county and the GLC constitute local democracy .there be a form of local democracy that be much close to the people .Most of those in my area do not have any affinity with the metropolitan council .they hardly know their metropolitan councillor .however , they be close to the district council and to the councillor of the city of Leeds , because most of the service that matter to they be district service .Most of the money be district money .only just over 20 per cent .be spend by the county council .that great monolith , the GLC , with all its bureaucracy , provide only one sixth of the money that be spend on service that affect the people of London .
