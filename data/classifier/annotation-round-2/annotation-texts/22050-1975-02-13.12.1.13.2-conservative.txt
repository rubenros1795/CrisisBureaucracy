I congratulate the hon .and learn Member for Montgomery ( Mr. Hooson ) on his speech .it seem to I that he take the debate away from bureaucracy into the area of local government organisation and rating , which be vital matter , and the right hon .member for Dartford ( Mr. Irving ) take the matter even far into reform of local government and the problem it face .
