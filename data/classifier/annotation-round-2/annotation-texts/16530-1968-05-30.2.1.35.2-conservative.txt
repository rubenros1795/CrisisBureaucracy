throughout the Committee stage I be chiefly concerned with the licensing provision , and it be on that part of the Bill that I should like to speak now .it be monstrous that this part of the Committee stage be so ruthlessly guillotine , for this mean that many aspect of both quality and quantity licensing be never properly discuss .the whole question of quality licensing be not very contentious , and the Opposition 's purpose throughout the Committee stage be to try to keep the red tape and bureaucracy down to the minimum .
