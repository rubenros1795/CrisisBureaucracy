it be no accident that historically the great industrial birth of this country be in area in the North , in the South and in Wales before the day of bureaucracy .it be only since the day of bureaucracy — the growth of government — that there have be the pull towards the Metropolis .I fear that the Government be go in exactly the opposite way to decentralise industry from the South and from the South - West by increase the bureaucracy by over 1,000 , with an expenditure of £ 3 million a year .this will pull industrialist to the South and bring they near to the Metropolis and have exactly the opposite effect to that which be desire .
