I hope that the new clause will have the support of both side of the House .I put it forward in the interest of the good working of the Scottish Assembly .an Assembly of the size that I , propose be much more in accordance with the wish of people in Scotland .it be not necessary to have an Assembly of the size propose by the Government .by propose it , the Government be gratuitously yield to the argument of those who oppose the Assembly on the ground of additional cost and bureaucracy .I hope that for the second and subsequent election the Government will accept an Assembly of the size that I suggest .
