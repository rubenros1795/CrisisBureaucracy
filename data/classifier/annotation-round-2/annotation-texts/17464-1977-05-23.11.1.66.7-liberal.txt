on the subject of authority , it be quite right that someone , somewhere , should be responsible for everything that go out to the public , but we do already have two authority that work pretty well .surely the idea should be to make those authority work well rather than create yet more authority which will be even more expensive , which will give manifestation of even great patronage and simply create another tier of bureaucracy .
