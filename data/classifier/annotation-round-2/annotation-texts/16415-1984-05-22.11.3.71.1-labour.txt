I should like to give another example of the bureaucratic and inefficient nature of the water authority , by refer to the North West water authority .the Bill be about establish organisation that be unaccountable and non - democratically elect , like water authority .I ask the Secretary of State for the Environment how many legal case have be bring against the North West water authority , how much it have pay in claim and in solicitor ' fee , and how many such case have be settle with and without proceeding .the answer be that the information be not available , be not keep centrally and could not be obtain from the North West water authority .that be a typical example of the bureaucracy in water authority .if they be democratically elect , the information would be available .
