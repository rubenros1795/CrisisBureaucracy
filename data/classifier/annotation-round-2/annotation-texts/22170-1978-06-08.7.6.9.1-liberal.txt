do the Home Secretary agree that it be not only the question of pay that be cause frustration in the police ?will he look at the complaint procedure ?I support they , but the bureaucracy in the right hon .Gentleman 's Department be cause concern to the police .it be take chief officer and other way out of their own area for long period of time .surely this could be simplify , and this would lead to few policeman leave the service over complaint which turn out to be trivial .
