I agree .I should be in favour of harmonisation of the rule so far as they affect insurance company .but what I be say be that this House ought to have more involvement and ought to be allow to be more selective as to what it accept and what it do not .the bureaucracy in Brussels , to justify its existence and to expand its power and influence , be proliferate a whole series of measure which nobody really want , and this House be powerless to do anything about it .
