I wish to say a few word on the BBC 's regional structure .one can agree with all the Annan criticism of the BBC bureaucracy , because the BBC 's problem be mainly problem of scale and bureaucracy .surely the answer to bureaucracy and centralisation be not to cut off local root in the form of the island site that the BBC have be try to develop to compete with commercial television .the answer be to encourage the BBC to expand its regional production and to integrate its regional production with its network production centre in the region and to provide commercial television with competition similar to that which commercial radio provide to BBC local radio â€” competition for the benefit of both .
