one of the difficulty that we have in a long chain of command be that we be try to control the use of public money and therefore introduce mechanism of accountability which in turn become bureaucratic irritation to people in the front line try to get on with the job of training .I think that the Manpower Services Commission have to look carefully at its relationship with the EITB and other to make certain that there be no more bureaucracy than be need to give we a reasonable degree of accountability .
