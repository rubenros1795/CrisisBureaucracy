although I welcome my right hon .and learn Friend 's strategy , I welcome some of the specific measure rather less than other .I be sorry that he feel it necessary to make the vat rate quite as high as 15 per cent . , although I strongly welcome the unification of the rate .it always seem to I to be absurd to have two different rate , cause excessive complication to those run business as well as encourage bureaucracy .the fact that we be now revert to one rate only will , to my way of thinking , be a great advantage to industry and commerce .
