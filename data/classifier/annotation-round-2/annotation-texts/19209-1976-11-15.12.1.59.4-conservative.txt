I believe that this measure also bring near the end of private patronage .an ecclesiastical bureaucracy would manage what I can only call the diocesan machine .I fear that the clergy 's status would be weaken by this measure and the time could come when the parochial clergy could be move about like pawn on a chess board .their independence would be threaten as well as their freedom of speech , and nonentity would be place in charge of they .
