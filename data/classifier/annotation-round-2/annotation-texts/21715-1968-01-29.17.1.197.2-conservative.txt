I welcome this debate , unlike hon .member opposite , because I regard this as a matter which be cause great public concern and which , above all thing , ought to be debate in the House .I suppose that I can claim to be , in some respect , a pioneer in the pursuit of statistic about bureaucracy .look back , I find that I put my first series of question down on the subject as long ago as April , 1965 .I have put a good many question down since then , and I be not repentant about the cost involve because it be information which the Government of the day should have to hand , should be prepare to give the House and should not find themselves pay additional money to collect .
