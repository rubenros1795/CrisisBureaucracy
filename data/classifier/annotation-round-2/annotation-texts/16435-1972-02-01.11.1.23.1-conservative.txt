"in so far as there have be "" the damp hand of bureaucracy "" , I think there be no doubt that my proposal will reduce that .this have be one of the real problem , but we be try to operate a levy - grant system among very large number of individual undertaking , and when do so in an industry where there be large number of small undertaking it be virtually impossible to do so except by bureaucratic method .this be one of the reason why it have become counter - productive , but I be sure that we shall reduce that so far as it exist ."
