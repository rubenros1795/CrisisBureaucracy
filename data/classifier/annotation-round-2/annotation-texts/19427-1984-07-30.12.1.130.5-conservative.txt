there be one aspect about all this which be totally unprecedented .I know of no Government in modern time who have tackle the business of lift a whole tier of bureaucracy from the back of ratepayer and taxpayer .the whole process of modern government have be a steady expansion of bureaucracy and steady increase in the number of people in large black car give themselves air , and all the rest of it .it be ironic that the Labour party , which have many strong root in the William Morris tradition of small government , always stand for the maintenance and increas of all bureaucratic power in all circumstance .all the speech of Opposition member have be about the representation of an interest — that interest may be legitimate — and have be about nothing more than the protection of great organisation seek to defend themselves .
