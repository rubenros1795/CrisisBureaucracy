I invite the hon .Lady to look at Part I of the White Paper , and at paragraph 34 in particular .it state that the provision for some service in some area will have to be reduce ; and there will be a fall in staff number , estimate in England and Wales at 20–30,000 .a sharp reduction would have be require but for a switch of about £ 130 million from previously plan capital to current expenditure that mean that local government have decide to spend on the maintenance of its own current programme £ 130 million and to slash other programme to the same extent .that be one of a number of illustration of the way in which the Government be allow bureaucracy to continue undisturbed at the expense of those in the building industry .
