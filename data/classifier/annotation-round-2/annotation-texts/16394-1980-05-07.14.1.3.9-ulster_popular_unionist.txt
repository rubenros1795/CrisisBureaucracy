it be clear that the decision to abolish the Trust be one of stupid bureaucracy .it be be do because of party political dogma .it be a decision that do not take note of the special problem in Northern Ireland .it be a decision that will exacerbate unemployment in the Province , because job in food processing , packaging and marketing will go elsewhere .they will be lose to other country .let the Government remember that 75 per cent .of Ulster farmer depend upon export sale .therefore the decision to axe the Trust will have an adverse effect not only on the agricultural community but on the entire Ulster economy .
