my hon .friend the Member for Salisbury ( Mr. Key ) be right about the definition of equivalent or alternative .I can imagine much debate continue in education authority , in room in which school government be discuss and maintain , about what be an equivalent .the mind race a little at the prospect of a star system , with two brown star or three red star be award for offence .the child can build up something like a green shield stamp book â€” a passport to infamy , and possibly expulsion and suspension .I do not believe that that be in the mind of the hon .Member for Denton and Reddish .one can imagine the bureaucracy that would be involve in the creation of a bible of definition for use by those responsible for the control of child in school .
