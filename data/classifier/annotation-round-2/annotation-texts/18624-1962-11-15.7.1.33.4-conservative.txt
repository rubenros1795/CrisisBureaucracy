with regard to enforcement ; again I be very glad to see that my right hon .friend have follow the advice of the Gowers Committee , where we have earnest consideration as to whether we should recommend that there should be a central inspectorate or whether it should be do by the local authority .we be give much evidence on the subject which be very helpful to we .we finally come to the conclusion that , apart from the factor that my right hon .friend mention , to set up a central inspectorate would involve a large , new bureaucracy which would involve a certain amount of duplication .we be very much persuade that there be a great advantage in have local authority carry out the function of inspection because it bring local interest into this matter of inspection in an entirely different and strong way .I be sure that be a great advantage .
