that be the next point with which I be about to deal .this be the other aspect of the problem .but there be no such surrender .there be a surrender on paper .there be a Commission in Brussels whose function be to make proposal for the common good .we shall be represent on that Commission .we shall have on that Commission as strong a voice as all the other major States which be party to the Treaty .the Commission make the proposal , but they be disposed of by the Council of Ministers .on the Council of Ministers we shall have representation equal to that of the large state which will be our fellow in the Community , and the Ministers on the Council of Ministers will answer to this sovereign Parliament .that be the answer to those who fear the bureaucracy in Brussels .
