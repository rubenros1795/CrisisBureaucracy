of course , it be true that , as the conservative lawyer point out , the need for some kind of grievance machinery in the modern world scarcely need to be emphasise .the point at which the individual can come into contact with what he be inclined to call bureaucracy be increase in number , and the consequence to the individual can be extraordinarily grievous , as we all know from our constituency experience , even without the small intention on the part of the Government of the day to harm the individual complain , and sometimes even without their knowledge .therefore , in the multifarious action of authority , grievance machinery of some kind be an essential part of modern administration .
