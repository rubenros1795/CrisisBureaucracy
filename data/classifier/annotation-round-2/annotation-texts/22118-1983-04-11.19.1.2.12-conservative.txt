I come now to what I consider to be the major reform require in the tourism infrastructure — the creation of a single tourist authority for the United Kingdom embrace all facet of tourist infrastructure head by a full - time professional executive chairman .the Development of Tourism Act 1969 have exist for some 13 year .sufficient time have elapse to enable we to pin down its weakness and success .I believe that the exist structure allow for an overlapping of function and too much bureaucracy .the present structure be less cost - effective than they should be and the enormous financial resource devote by central Government to tourism be be divert from what must be the fundamental objective of any tourism structure — the attraction of overseas visitor and the provision of tourist attraction in the United Kingdom .
