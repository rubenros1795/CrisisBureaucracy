I have say many time at this Dispatch Box in the last five year that if the hon .Gentleman would give an undertaking to support such a proposal , we would have introduce it .I conclude on a non - controversial and realistic note .we now have four set of bureaucracy in Birmingham — a county council , a district council , a water authority and a health authority — all of which have to be pay for and none as efficient overall as the old Birmingham county borough council .let we hope that we can return to that efficiency .I regret that we can not do so today .
