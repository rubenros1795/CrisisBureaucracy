what will be the financial implication for local authorite if clause 1 be carry ?my hon .friend the Member for Burton ask where the money would come from .I commend to the House a letter that appear recently in that excellent and celebrated newspaper , the Daily Telegraph .it come from the Chairman of Kent county council youth and community service sub - committee .the author , Felicity Simpson , write : I write to contribute to the debate on the value of the Youth and Community Bill … this Bill be surely one of the most well - intentione but totally misguided measure to come before Parliament .I shall not trouble the House by repeat the whole letter .however , she continue : it seem wholly unproductive in term of cost and the involvement of young people in their own affair for this Bill to impose the setting up , and the servicing by local authority , of youth council … with a membership age up to 26 year .this will involve costly administrative and professional time .the Bill also dictate the membership and chairmanship of a joint committee of local authority and voluntary youth organization … thereby upsetting local arrangement .as this Bill do not provide any more finance to the Youth Service, … not only will its effect be to switch resource away from teenager in local authority club to already well motivate 21–26 - year - old , but also it will force a reduction in the grant - aid and advice - time pump - prime organisation .that letter be write by someone with considerable experience .it reflect the point make by my hon .friend the Member for Burton .if clause 1 be enact it would not improve youth opportunity , but would divert resource away from exist service .those resource would be channel into new system of bureaucracy .I seriously wonder whether they would advance the interest of the young .
