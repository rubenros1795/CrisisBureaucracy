I take note of what have be say about how one - armed bandit and jackpot machine assist local club .the Commission be right when it say that the public use the machine be entitle to know the amount of money that be return from the machine .I agree with the Commission that not less than 75 per cent .should be pay back .that would leave a handsome profit on which to run the club .the proposal would not require a great deal of bureaucracy .all that would be require would be for the Gaming Board to be satisfied that the machine to be instal conform to the requirement .the question of the availability of key be a straightforward criminal matter for the police .
