I suggest that the Government circularise local authority and say that where they employ sub - contractor they must abide by the rule .the Government may take the rest of the requirement out of the Act .that would meet the case .I be try to meet the legitimate need to tighten up but at the same time to cut out a lot of bureaucracy .I have suggest a fourth way , but the Minister merely say that those in the industry think that it be well to do it in this way .I should declare an interest , as I have a connection with a builder .all the building people engage in the industry find that there be a great deal of bureaucracy and nonsense .the Minister 's answer so far have not meet the point .
