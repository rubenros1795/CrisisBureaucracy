the election will be fight on the question whether people want to give more power to government or want more power to make their own decision over their life .I understand and know that many people join the Labour Party to protect the little man against the big battalion , but now Labour have become the party of the big battalion and big bureaucracy .another Labour Government will put infinitely more power into the hand of Government , because so many of they believe in collective decision and make far too many decision political and leave far too few to be take by people on matter affect their own life in their own way .
