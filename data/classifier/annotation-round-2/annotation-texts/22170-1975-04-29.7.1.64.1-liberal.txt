"I beg to move to leave out from "" that "" to the end of the Question and to add instead thereof : this House decline to give a Second reading to a Bill which be unlikely to solve the long - stand problem of the development of land in a manner which could give a fair return to the community while avoid vast public expense and the growth of bureaucracy .this be a very sad day , and the initial SAD happen to stand for second appoint day .presumably that will come to we at some time .I feel — and this be an expression of opinion that have be make from both side of the House — that a great opportunity have once again be lose .after all our experience since 1945 it should have be possible to bring forward legislation on which all party could largely agree .we have hear again this afternoon that the Conservative Party be already commit to repeal this Bill just as a Conservative Government repeal the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 .I think that they be probably wrong to do that .they be definitely wrong , when they come to power in 1970 , immediately to repeal the Land Commission Act 1967 and speedily to wind up the Land Commission .I readily agree that the betterment levy under that Act be a nonsense .it be quite easily replace by capital gain tax ."
