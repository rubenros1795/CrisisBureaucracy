to succeed , a Scottish Parliament would need to be real , fair and efficient , and to be see to be so .to be real , the Parliament would need to be able to raise taxis and to disburse expenditure .political authority would be impossible if no such financial provision be grant .to be fair , the Parliament would require to be elect by some system of proportional representation .the present mismatch between vote and seat in this place be indefensible and would be see to be so in any body set up .to be efficient , the new Parliament would need to preside over a much slim local authority bureaucracy .the 1973 reform have be find want in many respect .it have not be a success and the relationship between the new Parliament , the Scottish Office and regional and district council would be recast to make the system financially tight and more accountable to the electorate .
