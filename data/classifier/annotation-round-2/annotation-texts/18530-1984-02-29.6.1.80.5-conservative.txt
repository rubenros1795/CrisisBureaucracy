the Lewisham debate centre on the fact that , while , time and again in public , councillor talk about the rate burden and service , they do not tackle the fundamental reform necessary to achieve great efficiency and saving .the real issue for they be support for an index - link , overweight , overman bureaucracy embrace public sector union .how can it possibly be right for a council whose main budgetary item be manpower to be tie , on the one hand , by its own no redundancy policy and , on the other , by a union refusal to cover any job vacate by people move on or retire ?this can not pretend to be efficient management , or in the interest of the people of the borough .the urgency for this legislation be highlight by this fact because it be the ratepayer who , year after year , have to foot this escalate bill .
