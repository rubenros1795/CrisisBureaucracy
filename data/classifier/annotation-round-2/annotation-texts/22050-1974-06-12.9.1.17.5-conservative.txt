the point of try to control price of food in large or small shop beat I .I be refer now not to clause 4 and 5 but to clause 2 and the power to regulate food price .in her statement today the Secretary of State assure we that the voluntary agreement mean that firm with turnover over £ 250,000 would follow the diktat of the bureaucracy .that do not interest I , because we be be ask to pass legislation which will be the law of the land .I see no reference in the Bill to £ 250,000 or £ 25,000 or any other level of turnover .the Government be ask we to give the bureaucracy power to fix the price at which any of the specify food can be sell in any shop , large or small .this to I be totally unacceptable .therefore , after much consideration , I shall probably come down on the side of support the clause , in spite of the fact that I think it be woefully inadequate .
