"it be clear to I that the rôle of the tenant of a public authority be not a bed of rose .I be sure that time and time again we all find constituent — public authority , new town , or council tenant — come to we with the same theme : "" all I want to do be to swop house with Mrs. Bloggs , or Mrs. Smith , who live in a different town , or a different sector of the town . ""time and time again we find that bureaucracy can not cope with that kind of request .housing manager in local authority , beset by all sort of problem , need the most extraordinary ground before allow a tenant to be move .for they , the fact that he want to move be not enough .I believe that if a tenant want to move , basically he have every right to do so .it be the failure of bureaucracy , particularly in public housing , that I greatly regret .I believe that those two proposal could do something to help home ownership ."
