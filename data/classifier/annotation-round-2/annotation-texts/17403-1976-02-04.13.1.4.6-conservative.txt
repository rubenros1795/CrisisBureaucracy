the Prime Minister be on the record as say that a week be a long time in politic .three year be even long .event have move on and the people of London be not prepared to wait any long for the chance to vote .I have be consistent in fight proposal to delay local election .I do so in 1948 and 1967 and I do so again tonight .those delay be all introduce by and on the initiative of labour government .the curious thing , which follow from something that the right hon .Gentleman say , be the fact that , rather as in one of the Sherlock Holmes book , the dog do not bark .from 1973 to 1975 there be total public silence from Labour .when in Government they be clearly too busy override the law to save their Clay Cross friend to worry about London .the Minister be too busy pass the Community Land Bill , increase the local and national bureaucracy , to look after the interest of London .
