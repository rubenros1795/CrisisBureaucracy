I enter the strong possible protest about this procedure .here we be , at 11 o'clock , in a House that be hardly crowded , deal with the first of what will be a torrent of Regulations under the Act .thus be the right of the citizen erode .obviously we must welcome these exception as far as they go .we can not amend they .we can only vote against they or approve they .we be in a difficult position .they emphasise the complication , absurdity and , more important , the bureaucracy involve in the Act .these exception will entail considerable bureaucracy .
