I be a keen european and I be quite prepared for a good deal of this kind of nonsense , but I hope that our entry into the EEC would diminish it somewhat .I still hope that it will diminish .last week the Chairman of the Commission blame Whitehall for be bureaucratic , as if he be a snow - white innocent in the matter of bureaucracy before he become chairman and afterwards .but the Foreign Secretary should ask he to look at the harmonisation practice of the Commission to see whether he can make they less bureaucratic .
