I disagree with the method suggest by the hon .member for Bridgend for application for cl .at the moment , whichever club be involve , it police the system .it have discretion whether to issue a CL licence .the hon .Gentleman propose that the organisation must give write notification to the local authority .the Association of District Councils do not ask for that .it do not want that addition to bureaucracy , but the Caravan Club would agree that where a local authority ask that it should always be give write authority , that would be do .that be fair enough .
