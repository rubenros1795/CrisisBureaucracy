I do not wish to be inaccurate .knitwear engineering be an example of a type of course , of which there be only two or three , which be in jeopardy .the Government should not simply stand back and watch what happen for two year , but that be exactly what they have decide to do .they be talk in term of a Â£ 375 million capped pool .they say that they will fix the pool on the basis of a Treasury diktat .they do not intend to have consultation about what should be invest in high education .instead , someone will pull out a piece of paper from a bran tub .the mean by which the figure be arrive at be shroud in bureaucracy and be not subject to open government .
