the awful thing be that the Bill be about what this wretched bureaucracy will do .I should like to know when it will start .it will be £ 1 million when it start and it will cost £ 400,000 to run it .I should like some detail about it .who will be the chairman ?what will he be pay ?can he be sack ?what staff will he need ?will there be a separate commission in Scotland and in Wales ?I be sure that the devolution Bill would be hideously offend if there be not a separate Scottish Public Lending Right Commission with a separate scottish chairman , and a Welsh one as well — and an irish one if necessary , an English one and a few other , and an overall commission .I do not know how many other Labour member certain Labour member want to get rid of , but surely we can think of other people for whom job could be make in the matter of public lending right .
