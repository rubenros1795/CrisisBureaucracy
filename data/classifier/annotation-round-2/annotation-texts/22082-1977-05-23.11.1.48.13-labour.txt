there be two way in which to deal with this .one be to federate , to turn it into an imitation ITV .but if one accept the BBC as a national instrument of broadcasting and that it have a centralised planning structure and that many advantage flow from that , the only real practical change be to separate radio and television and have two separate service run as two separate public corporation build out from under the kind of bureaucracy that lie across they both , attempt to co - ordinate and hold they together .that be what the minority of the Committee want .
