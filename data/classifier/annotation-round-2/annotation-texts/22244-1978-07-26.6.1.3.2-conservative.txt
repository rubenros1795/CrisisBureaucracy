will the Secretary of State appreciate that there be one recommendation with which we entirely disagree and another about which we have grave misgiving ?on the allocation of the fourth channel , we agree with the basic aim both of the Annan committee and the Government that a fourth channel should provide different kind of programme from those on the exist channel .but just as I reject the Annan concept of the OBA in the debate on 23rd May last year , so now we dissent from the Government 's proposal on financial ground .we believe that the plan as outline would place a totally unnecessary burden on the taxpayer through a deliberate increase in public expenditure with a new bureaucracy and a direct financial contribution from the Government .
