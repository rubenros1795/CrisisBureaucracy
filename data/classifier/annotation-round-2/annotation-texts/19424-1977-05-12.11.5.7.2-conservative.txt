I turn to the central question .I ask the Financial Secretary whether all this be worth while .I ask he a question on this subject in our last debate .the Financial Secretary say that we be talk about tax evasion , which be cost the Revenue about £ 10 million .I wonder whether the whole process be worth while .there be substantial argument against it .the Financial Secretary owe it to the House to give a clear indication why he believe that a tax loss of £ 10 million justifie all the extra bureaucracy , the attack on personal freedom and the many undesirable activity about which we hear .
