the hon .member for Stockport , North ( Mr. Bennett ) ask how the sanction would operate .I touch on that in my opening remark .I say that we have consider carefully whether we should institute a system of licence .it would have be cumbersome , it would have involve a substantial increase in bureaucracy and it would have create a machine that might have be redundant before it be finish .we come to the conclusion that that would not be sensible .we decide instead that sanction should be operate on the basis of declaration by exporter that the good involve be not prohibit export under either of the order .firm will be require to enter detail of their export with Customs , together with a declaration before any good be ship .they will then be able to export their good .however , Customs have the power to go to their office and investigate their document to find out whether the basis of the declaration be truthful .it will be use that power .that be a well solution .Customs will check good as they leave , check the declaration and search the evidence .it will be up to the exporter to demonstrate that the declaration be base on a set of circumstance that justify make it .that be the way in which we shall administer the order .
