the National Assistance Board be a triumph of wise and sympathetic administration .it belie the jeer which be frequently throw at bureaucracy and at that hypothetical , if not mythical , gentleman from Whitehall who be always suppose to know good .it be also a refutation of the frenchman who say that precedent be to the civil servant as brain be to man .one thing about the National Assistance Board be that its administration be flexible and it use freely and fully its discretionary power .although equally deserving , how envious the Inland Revenue Department must be of the National Assistance Board and its repute for a humanitarian approach to the problem and need of the people .all those who pay tribute to the National Assistance Board should have a thought for those who collect the money .
