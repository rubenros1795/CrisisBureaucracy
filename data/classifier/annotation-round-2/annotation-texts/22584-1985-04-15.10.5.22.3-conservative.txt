the hon .Gentleman also refer to the increase in bureaucracy .I listen with interest to what he say .I can not share his vision of the future — many extra hour of work be impose on school clerical staff — although I accept that there will be some extra work .however , a tremendous amount of extra work will fall on school clerical staff and teaching staff if there be an increase in the number of expulsion and suspension .many govern body discuss expulsion and suspension .report be ask for , and they be often submit to the local education authority .that process involve type checking , reformulation , copying and postage , all of which involve extra expenditure and work .I therefore have double vision when listen to the hon .Gentleman 's speech .
