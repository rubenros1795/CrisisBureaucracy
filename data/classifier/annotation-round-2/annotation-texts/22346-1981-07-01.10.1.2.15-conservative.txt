I have already discuss with my hon .friend the use of area of outstanding natural beauty .as he know , I be unimpressed by the add bureaucracy and toothless designation that attach to that planning feature .I be more concerned that the 75 per cent .of the land area not cover by this or any similar designation may be undervalue , demote or regard as expendable by comparison .in other word , I feel that all agricultural land should be regard as special for planning purpose .
