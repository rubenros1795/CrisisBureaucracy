why be that ?I think there be a certain significance in the fact that in its supplement last Thursday the Daily Telegraph print an article by an ex - political leader on this very matter .he say : be we go into Europe now to make a proper job of it , or will Britain shrink back in timid isolation ?he go on : Europe will not work without a large measure of common government .that be write by Sir Oswald Mosley , the ex - leader of the British Union of Fascists , and that be really the clue to the repugnance of many british people about Britain 's inclusion in the Community .they do not want to be subject to an authoritarian bureaucracy , and they believe that that would be the answer if we go into the Community .
