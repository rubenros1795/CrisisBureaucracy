I be not in favour of co - ordination purely for its own sake .co - ordination often involve we in create another tier of bureaucracy .I do not think that that be what Timbury envisage .there be a need to ensure effective liaison between a social work department and the health service .I have a pertinent example of the lack of such liaison only today .it be a personal matter and I shall not detain the House with it .it relate to an individual very close to I , who suffer , in my view , from dementia .
