in his own argument , what my hon .friend do be to present to the House an admirable description of the South - West Tourist Association , and he indicate how with a tiny budget , £ 13,000 , it be , if anything , do a far well job for the region than all the great national organisation that have so far intervene in its affair .what a splendid case he make out !he illustrate the significant difference between money provide privately by the voluntary association which produce the £ 13,000 and the rather less effective job which would have be do , and be be do , by Government fund and Government bureaucracy .it seem to I that , far from make his case , my hon .friend prove precisely the opposite .he prove that a private organisation use voluntary fund be far more likely to do an effective job than all the big bureaucracy that be propose in his Amendment and all through the Bill .
