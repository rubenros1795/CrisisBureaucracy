why this major difference make between Wales and Scotland ?it be not because a legislature be good for Scotland but not good for Wales .London government have not consider what be good for Wales as a nation .the difference of treatment be cause by the difference between the strength of the two national party , and the Labour Party in Wales be induce to accept an unjustified discrimination against Wales and a discrimination between two nation which have the same kind of problem and background .in May 1976 the Labour Party 's Welsh Conference , attend by Welsh Labour Members of Parliament , come out overwhelmingly for an elect Assembly and , incidentally , against a referendum , and this decision be reaffirm by the 1977 conference .despite the enormous growth of the power of the State , the enormous growth of bureaucracy and the enormous growth of centralism , the Welsh be to be deny the power to make their own policy decision , and the party which have for so long promise Wales a Parliament again fail the country .
