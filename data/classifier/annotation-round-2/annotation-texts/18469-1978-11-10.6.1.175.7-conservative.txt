if the Bill be to help author alone , regardless of whether they be deprive by library borrowing , let we do it more sensibly .if we want to make a special payment to they , let we do it on book sale , through the retailer , the publisher or the Arts Council .there be many way in which we can help author .let we not do it through a crazy scheme of this kind , with so much go on administrative expense , build up yet another quango , another bureaucracy , with most of the benefit go to civil servant or quasi civil servant and not to author .
