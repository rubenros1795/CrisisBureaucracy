I pay tribute to the ingenuity of the hon .Member for Berwick and East Lothian and those who advise he in the way that the amendment be draw so as to bring it within the rule of order .it would , however , make possible only a theoretical reduction of taxation and government in Scotland .if it be carry to its logical conclusion we might find that people who be work in England be hasten to reside in Scotland because the taxation there be low .of course , in reality it would not be low , because the mere weight of increase bureaucracy would ensure that it be not .theoretically , it could possibly be low and that would lead to the ridiculous result — ridiculous in the mind of many Labour member — of people flee England to pay low taxis in Scotland .
