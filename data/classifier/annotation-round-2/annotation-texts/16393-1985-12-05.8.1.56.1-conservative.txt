as a non - academic , I congratulate my right hon .friend on this decision and ask he to note that the heart - on - sleeve doctrine of Labour Members be that it be well to spend money on international bureaucracy — provide that they be of the Left — than on human being in need .would it not be reasonable , if we be ever to rejoin this wretched organisation , to require it to live in the third world , not in the middle of Paris ?
