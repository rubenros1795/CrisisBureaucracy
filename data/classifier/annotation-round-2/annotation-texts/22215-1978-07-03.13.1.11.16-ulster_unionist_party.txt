there be one thing that I can not agree with , and my right hon .friend the Member for Down , South have already refer to it , all too briefly .I for one would seriously question the right of the Department or the Northern Ireland Housing Executive to take step to acquire land in settlement or village for sale or leasing to individual .this be not the way to encourage owner - occupier .it merely enmesh they far in the control of bureaucracy and inhibit the style and character of private development .
