if benefit be make universal , it be almost certain that those in real need will never receive enough .therefore , I come down firmly in favour of a selective system and use the tax system to run and administer it .I have no problem with the idea that the tax system should therefore embrace everyone .for a start , everyone be already in one system or another .everyone be either in the tax system or in the social security system , or both , so we be not suggest a vast extension of bureaucracy .I do not recoil from the idea that everyone in the country should sign and send in a tax return at the end of the year .that be the american system .in the United States , the tax year run from 1 January to 31 December .by the follow 15 April , everyone must send in a sign tax return .of course , employer collect tax on behalf of employee through the year , and taxpayer also have to account for certain other sort of income periodically through the tax year .
