the various trade Ministers and head of trade corporation whom I meet in China make it pretty clear that they want to buy a lot more from this country .there be , of course , the difficulty to which my hon .friend the Member for Leeds , West refer .I think that my hon .friend regard it as a piece of discourtesy on the part of the Chinese that they be not in the position to say what good they want to buy .I do not think it be really a matter of discourtesy but of bureaucracy , because the Chinese have not yet get out the detail of their second five - year plan and , until they have do so , they have not decide what good they want to buy .
