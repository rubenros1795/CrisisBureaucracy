when the GLC be abolish , a large number of quango will be set up under Government patronage , and I wonder how much democratic accountability there will be with those quango , which will cover a wide variety of topic on a London - wide basis .how much democratic accountability be there in water authority , such as the Thames water authority ?I suspect that there be very little , or perhaps none , but there will be more and more of such body , and less and less and less democratic accountability .there will be far more bureaucracy , subject to less democratic control under these quango .
