it have be say that the unfair dismissal procedure be put on the statute book by a Conservative Government .we be not quarrel with the principle .what I say be that we need to raise the threshold of bureaucracy beneath which small business can flourish .we be talk about raise the threshold of vat .let we try to raise the threshold of bureaucracy so that small business do not suffer as many of they be now suffer .I refer early to the Government spokesman we have hear today .I do so because the Chancellor of the Duchy would no doubt have say something totally different today .it be not a conservative spokesman but the chan- cellor of the Duchy who go into print in the Sunday Times of 27th November say : we must be careful that the Employment Protection Act be not turn into an Employment Destruction Act .the Chancellor of the Duchy recognise what be happen .he be on record as have say the same sort of thing elsewhere .he recognise the fear of business man .this fear be found not on a myth but on experience .
