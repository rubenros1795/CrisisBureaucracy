I deny absolutely the allegation against my Department , make by the hon .member for Widnes ( Mr. MacColl ) , that by bureaucracy and red tape we have seek to hold up local authority who have be seek to give improvement grant .on the contrary , our policy be to treat these case on their merit .but it be necessary that the condition lay down in the Statute should be observe .if the hon .gentleman for Islington , North ( Mr. Reynolds ) think that any of these condition for the standard grant be too restrictive , let I remind he that it will still be open to anybody to continue to apply for the old type of improvement grant which will not be so tightly bind round by condition .there be no difficulty about that .
