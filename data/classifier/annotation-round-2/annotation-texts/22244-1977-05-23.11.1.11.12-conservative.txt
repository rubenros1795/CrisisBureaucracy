I turn to the particular recommendation that have attract most discussion and controversy .first there be the proposal to give the fourth television channel to a new body , the Open Broadcasting Authority .despite my basic dislike of new body , which lead to more bureaucracy and cost , I certainly appreciate the Committee 's purpose .it want to ensure , as I understand it , that when a fourth channel be introduce it would provide programme of different sort , that minority interest would be cater for , and that independent producer would have great opportunity .the thinking behind the proposal for the Open Broadcasting Authority be , therefore , both original and imaginative .
