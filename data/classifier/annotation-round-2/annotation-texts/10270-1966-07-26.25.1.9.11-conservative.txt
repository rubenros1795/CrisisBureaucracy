I want to mention briefly the main omission from the present package .there be nothing to give people incentive ; there be nothing to encourage saving ; there be nothing to encourage efficiency ; there be no promise of economy in Whitehall ; there be nothing to encourage investment against great deflationary pressure ; there be nothing to encourage export , except , perhaps , hotel .here we see a typical example of the Government 's contradictory policy .they penalise all the hotel through the Selective Employment Tax , and now propose to set up a bureaucracy to try to make an administrative judgment on how hotel may help to encourage tourism , and to give they a loan .
