the argument about the use of the Equal Opportunities Commission must be bring out in this debate and in Committee .I be glad that a method have be devise so that a new commission need not be set up , but we still do not know whether the Equal Opportunities Commission be prepared to take on the extra responsibility .if it be , that will avoid the need to set up a new bureaucracy with all the expense that that would involve .
