I appreciate what the hon .Gentleman say in the first part of his question , even though he appear to withdraw it in the second part .it be not a question of bureaucracy or anything of the sort .the question be whether a person be prepared to speak honestly and straight about this matter .there be no way by which this dispute can be settle by the Government institute an inquiry .there be no way by which it can be settle by my meeting these signalman in the House of Commons or in any other way .
