if we be talk about bureaucracy — one of the word in the motion — let we also talk about the private , irresponsible , anonymous bureaucracy in multinational company .they be bureaucracy , too , and no different from public bureaucracy except that they exercise far great power than public bureaucracy and they be accountable to no one .they can close down factory in my constituency at a moment 's notice , blight the livelihood of whole family and bring gloom and despair to town such as Skelmersdale and Kirkby with no thought of the social consequence of their action .
