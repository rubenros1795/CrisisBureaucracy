I , as a Socialist , believe in planning , and anybody who attempt to equate planning with bureaucracy be do a disservice to the political argument and condemn socialism in a way that be most unfair .I believe in a plan economy .I believe that it be necessary for the State to have information in order to undertake proper planning .the State need to be able to exert an influence and to try to ensure that there be movement in a certain direction .therefore , it be valid for the State to ask for information .
