to continue to be practical , I hope not only in a technical sense but also in a political sense , I suggest that we should be realistic about some of the resistance to the establishment of the common fund .when I be in Washington I hear quite explicitly from official of AID , the department responsible for overseas aid in the United States , that a powerful argument against the idea of a common fund be that there would be a new bureaucracy and that bureaucracy would inevitably be dominate by the Group of 77 , that we should have the term of work of the common fund and its system stack against we as consumer .the bargaining chip , as it be , would be stack against we .
