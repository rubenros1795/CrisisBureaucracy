comparison be make with industry , particularly by my neighbour , the hon .member for Edinburgh , East ( Mr. Willis ) .he say that big business also suffer from inefficiency of one kind or another which cause waste .that may be true , but the point be that most industry and business have to survive in a competitive world and can not afford to indulge in waste .on the other hand , the Government and the bureaucracy be in a slightly different position .they do not have the competition that keep other people on their toe , and they do not have shareholder insist on the business be manage efficiently .
