in most case the Minister 's decision will probably be uphold , but even in those case the aggrieved person would feel less aggrieved .they would at least have the satisfaction of know that their grievance have be carefully examine by an independent tribunal .they and the whole country would know that they have some protection against bureaucracy and the insolence of office .they would know that , however unimportant they might seem , their right as free man would be recognise and uphold .that be the whole point .
