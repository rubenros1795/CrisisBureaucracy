I apprehend that an operator 's licence will be need for such vehicle and consequently a transport manager 's licence .this be multiply bureaucracy .I must declare an interest .I be the possessor of a second - hand septic tank emptier , a suction vehicle , purchase from my local authority , which enable I to avoid pollute certain ditch with silage effluent and to empty a few septic tank on my farm .we must occasionally cross road and therefore we have an exemption licence .
