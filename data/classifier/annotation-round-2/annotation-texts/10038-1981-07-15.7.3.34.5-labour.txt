I hope that we shall receive answer to those question .indeed , it would save the Treasury much time in the long term if it issue hon .member with a booklet give they guidance so that they can give the right information to those in this age group .if the Treasury do not issue such a booklet , some Treasury Ministers will have to answer many letter in the next month or two and will have to sort out a lot of anomaly .the answer be for the Government to accept the amendment , to remove the anomaly and to fulfil their election pledge to reduce taxation and bureaucracy .
