I be argue that the relaxation of the Rent Acts would produce more accommodation , with certain protection .my second argument be that the Government be right to sell council house to owner - occupier .that be a significant first step .however , there be perhaps a more important second step which the Government may consider in the next , if not in this , Parliament .I refer to the liberalisation of council house regime .that do not mean another Act , more public money , more office or bureaucracy , but quite the opposite .it mean release the vacant housing stock that be currently waste away in public ownership .there be 300,000 council unit lie empty all over Britain .they be build with taxpayer ' and ratepayer ' money .furthermore , 20,000 of they have be lie empty for more than a year .why ?council blame the Government , say they have insufficient resource to make the necessary repair and that until the house be fit to live in people can not move in .
