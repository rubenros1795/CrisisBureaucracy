let I quote directly from three authority which no doubt have make their view know to the member serve their area .first , Blaby council write : although a number of individual will be less constrain by plan control , even a great number will be provoke by their absence .although the number of application would be reduce , additional time would be take determine which proposal constitute permit development and deal with the enquiry and complaint which would be generate .I quote the view of the London borough of Barnet : Proposal ( a ) in the consultation document be consider unacceptable in the Metropolitan area where density of development be already relatively high and would inevitably result in extension which would be visually unsatisfactory and adversely affect the amenity of adjoining property .furthermore , even though such a relaxation would result in a reduction in the number of application for planning permission , there would be unlikely to be a reduction in the vetting procedure to define permit development , and certainly no reduction in correspondence arise from development actually undertake .I now quote from a letter from the South Oxfordshire district council , a council which I be sure be well known to the Secretary of State .the chief planning officer , a Mr. Phillips , write : it be my personal opinion that a reasonable professional process will merely be replace by a legalistic bureaucratic one … change the GDO will increase the work involve in volume and make the calculation more complex .no doubt the Ombudsman will confirm that dispute between neighbour very quickly become dispute between the aggrieved neighbour and the local planning authority , and explain the legal aspect of permit development be time consume when the people concern be obviously affect in an adverse way by the exercise of such permit development right .Mr. Phillips go on to say : I have give Mr. Heseltine , who be the Member of Parliament for a large part of this district , information to the effect that his proposal could reduce our application by 5 per cent .in number but that overall our workload could well increase , and I give the reason outline above .I feel very strongly that it be totally wrong for the Government to introduce legislative change to achieve bogus objective .the same gentleman write to I after the modification have be notify , say : I have repeatedly tell the Secretary of State and the DoE , that deal with an application be often quick than argue about whether it be permit development , and a good deal more rewarding for the professional staff .these order be a hotch - potch .however much the Secretary of State try to justify they as need or essential , however much he use jargon or gimmick , he will not do so in response to the demand of the people or the profession .he will seek to justify they on the ground that they will add to his armoury of weapon in his fight against bureaucracy and waste .his zeal be misplace , but , bad , he demean and diminish the work of a dedicated profession and democratically elect local councillor .he will gravely damage our environment ; he will set neighbour against neighbour ; he will bring our whole system of plan control into disrepute — all vainly to seek a reduction in public expenditure .in that he will fail , and we shall all be the poor .
