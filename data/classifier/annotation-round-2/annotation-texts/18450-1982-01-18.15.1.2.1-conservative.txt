— [ official Report , 21 December 1981 ; Vol .15 , c.610 . ]it be my contention that a Community energy policy in the EEC would be the most effective way of achieve the energy objective of individual member States , the objective as define by the Secretary of State , and that the example of the common agricultural policy be one to follow , though avoid the complication and the bureaucracy of the CAP , rather than to shun .the United Kingdom be far well place than any other EEC member to advance a sensible energy policy and to get it accept .the argument that should appeal to the super - subtle mind of the Secretary of State — I can hardly expect such deviousness from so untainted a politician as the Under - Secretary of State — be that merely by put forward a scheme in which our good european intention would be so manifest , we would enormously enhance our wilting reputation for be good community member and thus appreciably improve our chance of achieve our other objective within the EEC ."
