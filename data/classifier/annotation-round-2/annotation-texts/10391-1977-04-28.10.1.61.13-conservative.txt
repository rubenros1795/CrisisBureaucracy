I believe it be generally accept in all part of the House that we be somewhat over - legislate .but nowhere be the burden of such legislation feel more greatly than among small business and self - employ worker .they do not have the staff to cope with the unnecessary bureaucracy impose by government who have enter area which they know little about and in which , with respect , I consider they should not be .perhaps I shall say more about this in another debate .
