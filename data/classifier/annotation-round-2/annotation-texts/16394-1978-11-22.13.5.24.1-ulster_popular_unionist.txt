wherever they be not pay , I condemn it .everyone should pay his fair due .there be , in Northern Ireland , complaint that numerous serious offence be be commit — nothing to do with terrorism — and the Government and the bureaucracy do not seem to care .that be the feeling , whether it be right or wrong .the complaint be make that the police be busy deal with terrorism , to the detriment of the detection of other grave offence .
