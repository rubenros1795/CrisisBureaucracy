during the mass lobby a fortnight ago , I meet a contingent from Newport .those people could not be describe as militant in any sense of the term .they have no political affiliation whatever .they tell I that they would be as well off on the dole .I think that be a pretty shocking indictment .they also criticise family income supplement , which be introduce by the last Conservative Government .the describe it as nothing more than a recipe for low pay .they say that they be pick up their wage at one door , go round the corner and pick up family income supplement .again , that be a system that merely create bureaucracy .
