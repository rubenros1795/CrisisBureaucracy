I beg to move , as an amendment , to leave out from ' aircraft ' to the end of the Question and to add instead thereof : ' but , whilst agree with the international standard suggest by the International Civil Aviation Organisation , believe that they be well achieve through that body ; regard extension of EEC competence in the field of aviation as undesirable ; and deplore the duplication of exist machinery and the creation of additional bureaucracy . ' .there be no dispute about the need to control aircraft noise .this debate rellate solely to the question whether this directive be the right method .I would like to make one preliminary observation on the draft directive .as the explanatory memorandum make clear , acceptance of the draft directive would severely restrict the freedom of this country to operate an international agreement that be enter into .we would not be able to introduce domestic legislation in future on these matter unless the EEC have first agree that we could do so , even though we have be a member of the international organisation concern and have agree to do so there .there can be no dispute about this matter .it be contain in the Government 's explanatory memorandum .
