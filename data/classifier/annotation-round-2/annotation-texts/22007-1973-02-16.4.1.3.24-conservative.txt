a licence can be refuse for any know misconduct , for the inadequacy of the premise and for any improper conduct .the refusal to grant a licence must be communicate within seven day .the period of the licence can extend from one to five year .it be suggest that it might be one year , but I believe that we should have flexibility here to cut down on bureaucracy .we operate a similar system with drive licence .
