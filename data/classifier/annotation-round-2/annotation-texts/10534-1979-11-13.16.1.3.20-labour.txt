one would cut out bureaucracy rather than increase it .a certificate to drive could be award to those who pass the supervised test .it would therefore be possible to build in incentive , and at an early stage the young rider could learn the importance of roadcraft and training .however , I stress that this be part of a package of change which would provide a valuable step forward .I urge the Government not to pluck part out of the recommendation , because take individually they would make little sense .
