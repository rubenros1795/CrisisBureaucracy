the central proposal of the Bill be to set up an independent commission .in this respect , it be quite inadequate to meet the situation .the present situation need a much more radical solution .what make I curious about the proposal to set up a commission be the sight of so many conservative member express a keenness to establish a new bureaucracy â€” because the Bill would set up a small bureaucracy .presumably the commission could not function without official , and in the matter of make pension review it would need a fair collection of expert official who could stand up to and argue with the Government and Treasury expert .
