I do not believe that we shall have a sensible water policy until we have a national water grid .I want all water supply to be nationalise .that need not lead to a tremendous bureaucracy .it can be rationalise and make subject to elect authority .that be another reason for have regional elect authority as part of a federal system of devolution .if it do not happen , the United Kingdom will break up .however , that be as irrelevant a point as one or two of the issue raise by the right hon .member for Bermondsey , so I feel that I be in good company .
