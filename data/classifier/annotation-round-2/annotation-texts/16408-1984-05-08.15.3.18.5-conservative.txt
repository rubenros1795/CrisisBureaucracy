turn to the actual programme provision , the House will appreciate that , since neither the BBC nor the IBA as such will be responsible for provide the service , if it be to fit into our pattern of broadcasting arrangement , some responsible joint body will have to be bring into being .that will require another addition to the Bill .but I do not intend that the creation of this joint body , to bear responsibility for the transmission of the programme and for their standard and content , should involve a large new bureaucracy .I envisage that its member will be draw equally from the BBC 's board of governor and the member of the IBA .it must have a separate statutory existence , since its responsibility be not precisely the same as those of either of the exist broadcasting authority ; but , nevertheless , I believe that the board 's activity can be view as a logical extension of those of both the BBC and the IBA .the standard which the service will be require to meet will be those which would apply to a service under part ii of the Bill .
