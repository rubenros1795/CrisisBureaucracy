I refer first to the amendment move by the hon .Member for Waltham Forest ( Mr. Deakins ) .I should at once put he and his hon .friend the Member for Hackney , Central right over this question of what the amendment refer to as the duplication of exist machinery and the creation of additional bureaucracy .I be not sure , even now , that either of the hon .member have quite grasp the point .that must be my fault in not explain it adequately .this directive do not create additional bureaucracy or machinery — beyond the machinery and bureaucracy require for the member of the Community to receive from the Community a letter — presumably frank with a 9p stamp , or whatever it cost in Brussels — tell they that they be require to implement the standard of ICAO which be already in existence .
