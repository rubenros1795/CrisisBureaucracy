I do not condemn the Government 's proposal out of hand .it be virtually impossible to draw up an Assembly White Paper without cost a great deal of money , without create more bureaucracy , without delay in decision - making , without frustration and without the possibility of lead to the break - up of Britain .no matter how it be approach , I suggest that we come to the same conclusion : although there be a case for more decentralisation and although we want more of our decision - make process for the United Kingdom as a whole spread throughout the country , if we have two parliament and two government in one island sharing power in this mysterious way we have a recipe for disaster .
