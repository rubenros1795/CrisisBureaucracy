our beautiful countryside be the product not of state planner in the first place but of the million - fold decision of private owner .the state certainly have a vital role as a moderator of change , conciliator and sometimes arbitrator of conflict interest , and sometimes , in critical situation , as the deployer of long - stop power .this be so in the two huge area of the nation 's life which we be now discuss .as much in the art and the manmade heritage as in the natural environment , it be not state committee and bureaucracy that create thing , but recalcitrant artist and individual .the state must tread warily if it be not to extinguish the very pluralism and diversity that a healthy artistic culture need .
