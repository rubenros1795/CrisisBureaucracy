I think that we be discuss merely the tip of the iceberg of bureaucratic incompetence that be handle our affair .I do not believe that it have any relevance to the consumer or an effective part to play in the Government 's total pricing policy .it be an unnecessary piece of bureaucracy , an irritant to the shopkeeper and another wretched chore to weight and measure and trading standard officer .it should be take away and tear up .it be a piece of intervention which have long since outlive its usefulness .
