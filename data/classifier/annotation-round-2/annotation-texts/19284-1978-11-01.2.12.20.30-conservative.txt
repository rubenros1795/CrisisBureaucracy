I believe that the Government 's rigid 5 per cent .policy will fail .that be not because I believe that people should demand more than 5 per cent .for nothing .five per cent .for nothing as a starting point seem to I an ultimate recipe for inflation , if one then move the money supply up to accommodate it .however , I must just point out that the official guidance to civil servant on the 5 per cent .pay policy be one of the most pernickety bit of bureaucracy that I have ever see and one that I believe would bring productive and creative industry to a dead stop .let we just look at the first paragraph : any case which give rise to serious doubt should therefore be refer to the Department of Employment , who will arrange for it to be bring to the official Committee and Ministers as appropriate .so we shall get every single case in which there be any doubt go up to some central body .we shall have company — some of they very successful — which be produce export and have get the Queen 's Award for Export have two thing happen .first they have get the Price Commission in , cause all kind of trouble — although very few people there know what efficiency be in particular industry .then , just when they have have trouble and could make their own decision on the spot with their own shop steward and trade union , the matter have to be refer right up to some central body .
