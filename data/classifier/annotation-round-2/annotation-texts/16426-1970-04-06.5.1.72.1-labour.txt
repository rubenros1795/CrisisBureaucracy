may I first make one or two comment on the speech of the hon .member for the Isle of Ely ( Sir H. Legge - Bourke ) .I be sorry he be not here , as I find his speech a very interesting one .he put his finger on a dilemma which confront all those who be passionately concerned with the concept of public ownership but who , at the same time , recognise that within this concept lie the danger of bureaucracy clog up the wheel .the same danger exist in privately - own monopoly and in all modern , large - scale industry .
