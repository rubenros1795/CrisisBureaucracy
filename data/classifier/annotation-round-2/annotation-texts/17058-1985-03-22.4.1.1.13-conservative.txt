I be certain that this year 's Budget be a Budget for job and will make significant inroad into the unemployment figure .that will bring some scorn from those who aspire to miracle , but then miracle have a tendency to turn to ashe quickly .there be no easy panaceas .what be need be a well - train work force spur to great productive effort by a less crush tax regime , work for employer who be less burden by the bureaucracy ; worker who earn a good wage without synthetic overtime hour and who can look forward to sensible and flexible retirement arrangement .
