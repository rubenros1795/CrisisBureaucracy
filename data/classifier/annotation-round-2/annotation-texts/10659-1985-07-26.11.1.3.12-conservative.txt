there be obvious danger , as my hon .friend say , if the board divert local government from what it can do to help in basic policy area , in assemble land for example ; or if it lead to additional bureaucracy with its own priority , merely add to industry 's rate burden and impose excessive condition on the firm receive aid .problem would also arise if the scale and nature of the operation work against national or inner - city priority .those danger , while not inevitable , depend upon the guideline that be set for the board by the elect member , how its performance be monitor and how it be make accountable .
