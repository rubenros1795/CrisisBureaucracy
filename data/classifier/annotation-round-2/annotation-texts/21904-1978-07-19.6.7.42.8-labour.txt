of course , people say that they do not want an extension of bureaucracy .but in Wales , under the present government structure , there be community council , 37 district council , county council , the Welsh Office and the Secretary of Slate .for 3 million people that be not too bad when one consider that London , with 9 million people , have only the Greater London Council and the borough .we have a great deal of government in Wales .we be leave local government alone but on top of that we be create an Assembly .it could be say that we be not diminish bureaucracy but increase it .
