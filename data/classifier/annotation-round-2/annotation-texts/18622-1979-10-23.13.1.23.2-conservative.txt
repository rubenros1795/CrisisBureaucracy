I turn to the abolition of the Price Commission .I should tell the hon .member for Norwood that it be no use search in our policy for a modify system of price control ; it do not exist .nor do the pre - notification of price and the associated paraphernalia of a great bureaucracy which employ over 500 person and which would have cost nearly £ 8 million this year and lead to countless burden on british industry and commerce .for what purpose do it exist in the past ?the right hon .member for Birmingham , Sparkbrook ( Mr. Hattersley ) assure we that the Price Commission be not an agency for hold down the rpi .indeed , its power be limit to defer price increase and it perform that role successfully and visibly — not for political purpose — in the period lead up to the election .
