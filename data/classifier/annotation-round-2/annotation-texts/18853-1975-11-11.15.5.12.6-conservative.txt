subsection 5 ( b ) , if it be not amend , will be part of the wholly fearsome apparatus bring into be by the Bill , and I wish to make clear our attitude to this entire apparatus .we be absolutely pledge to repeal the Bill .I shall not go into that at length now , but the reason be manifold .first , it confer on local authority and joint board , or whatever other body the Government choose to employ , power and duty which , first , be wholly irrelevant and unnecessary for good planning .second , they be unnecessary for the recoupment of development gain .third , they be odious in their attack on the liberty of the individual , on his right to own property and on his protection against the power of public body .this be especially obvious when one see the excessive use of delegate legislation here propose .fourth , the Bill be calculate to promote both bureaucracy and public expenditure .at the end of it all , therefore , the Bill be purely and simply a socialist measure about land ownership , and the clause now before we be a good illustration of that .
