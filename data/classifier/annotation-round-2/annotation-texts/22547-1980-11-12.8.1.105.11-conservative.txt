finally , the argument have be advance that people will be pay badly if there be not public fund available to supplement their salary .I suggest that it be incumbent on the Opposition party , whichever they may be at any give time , to pay their staff the proper go rate for the job and to make sure , therefore , that they use the number of staff that they can afford to pay .the staff should be pay properly , but the number and size of the bureaucracy should never be consider as be the measure of the efficiency of the back - up to political party .
