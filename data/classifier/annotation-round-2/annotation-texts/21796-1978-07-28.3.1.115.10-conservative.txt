we all know from our surgery the frustration and exasperation of our constituent at the consequence of greatly extended bureaucracy .one of the thing which we can do for they be to investigate a case on their behalf , to compel consideration or reconsideration of some matter or decision already take .in relation to overall policy , it may not seem a major issue into which they ask we to look , but to the individual it be a major matter , and , of course , all of we in the House like to help people in that way as far as we can .but I often wonder how many more people there must be whom we could help and would like to help , as Members of Parliament , but who have not yet get in touch with we .
