I turn to the bureaucracy which we be create .this Government in particular have create a plethora of board , range from the absurd Rhubarb Advisory Board now to the Police Complaints Board .I be very much concerned about the extension of Prime Ministerial patronage that the Bill envisage , at a time when such patronage be already under sharp public scrutiny .after the honour list of the right hon .member for Huyton ( Sir H. Wilson ) , nine new fat cat , each pay an average salary of Â£ 10,000 a year , will be bring into the bureaucracy .the timing , if not the whole concept , be utterly wrong .
