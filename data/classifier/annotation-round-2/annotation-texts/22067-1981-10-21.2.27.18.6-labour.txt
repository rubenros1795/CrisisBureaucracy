it be absurd that youngster in my constituency should be treat in a different manner .Maltby have intermediate status and Rotherham and Mexborough and Wombwell be development area .it be quite right that they should be so categorise .their unemployment level be ridiculously high .Dinnington be even high , yet it be not assist .I hope that the Minister will not accept that the pattern of neat bureaucracy must always be the only criterion upon which decision be make .
