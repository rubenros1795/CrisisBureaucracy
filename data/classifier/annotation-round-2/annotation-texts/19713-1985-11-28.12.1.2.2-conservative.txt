the main objective of the Bill be to extend far our successful right - to - buy policy , by bring new category of tenant into the right to buy for the first time , and by increase discount for large number of tenant live in flat .the Bill also aim to improve and simplify the building control system , by cut down on unnecessary bureaucracy .the measure be in tune with a number of key element of the Government 's programme : it extend individual right and freedom , it encourage wide ownership of wealth and property , it promote the privatisation of large local authority estate , and it aim to cut out red tape .I believe that in all these respect it meet the aspiration of tenant and of the public at large , and I trust that the House will give it support .
