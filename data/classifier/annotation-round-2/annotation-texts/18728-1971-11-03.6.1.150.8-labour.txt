other hon .member have refer to other institution , but I will switch very quickly to a point of view express by my right hon .friend the Member for Kettering ( Sir G. de Freitas ) , who talk about a European Parliament .he ask for guarantee .I think that he have a valid argument .he be a sincere European and I have already respect his view .he believe that we should have a proper parliamentary check on the European Commission â€” that it must not be like the Assembly at Strasbourg , which he and I use to attend .but the Commission be the main body in Europe , even though there be a Council of Ministers .in a European Parliament we should be able to have 36 member , and my right hon .friend be concerned because inevitably we should have constituency as large as 1,500,000 people .he therefore ask for certain assurance .he may have faith in this sort of system , but I have not .all I can see in Europe at the moment be a vast european bureaucracy .
