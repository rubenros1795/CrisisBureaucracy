I believe that the philosophy of aid , the bureaucracy of aid , the motivation of aid giver be a direct burden upon the potentiality for progress of people all over the world .I could produce much evidence in support of that view .it put power into the hand of bureaucrat in under - develop country .it make their position very covetable , but it do nothing for the poor , wretched peasant , and it be on behalf of the poor , wretched peasant as much as the british taxpayer that I seek to argue .
