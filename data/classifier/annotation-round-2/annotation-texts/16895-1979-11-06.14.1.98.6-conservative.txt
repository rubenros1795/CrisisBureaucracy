as soon as the NEB company become profitable , they should return to the private sector .the neb must work with and complement the private sector , not compete against it .the NEB , far from be an agent of nationalisation and promoter of Government expenditure , will become an add buttress to the private sector .one of the more wishful aim of the neb have be to promote industrial democracy in its undertaking .industrial democracy mean that people should feel involved in the business in which they work .paradoxically , it be always those who work for Government - control institution who feel least involve .the ultimate decision over their life rest with a bureaucracy that be too remote and they do not feel that their opinion really count .the effort of the neb have suffer from that flaw .
