it be clear that all be not well with the Labour majority at County Hall .total disarray appear to be the order of the day .the next collapse be likely to come from the ratepayer themselves , who will not he able to pay their rate .there be no justification for they to think that they can break the law , but there be justification for they to think that total disaster lie ahead of they .it would be in London 's interest if a coalition could be form between the two party in County Hall to see the GLC through until 1977 , by which time plan might have be lay to trim down the massive bureaucracy represent by the GLC at present .
