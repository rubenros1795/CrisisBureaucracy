"I beg to move , to leave out from "" House "" to the end of the Question and to add instead thereof : call on the Government to ensure that proper control be exercise over the Common Agricultural Policy ; expect the Government to take all possible step to ensure that expenditure be make subject to effective limit and urge the Government to use the british veto as necessary to protect very important national interest ; urge the Government to ensure that area in Britain with special need receive a proper share of the regional aid budget ; believe that the European Council should be fully engage in planning job and give particular attention to youth employment and should not dilute its energy by focus on less important goal ; urge the European Council to cut the burden of bureaucracy and to reduce the number of Community rule and regulation ; and urge the Government to resist any proposal to dismantle border control which would interfere with its ability to combat terrorism and drug trafficking . "" .we in the Opposition be extremely glad that , even late in the day , the Government be debate in the House the major issue which will come before the Heads of Government conference at the European Council next weekend in Milan .it be not before time that the House of Commons have its opportunity to have a say on the great issue that preoccupy those who run the affair of state in the European Community .a mere eight day before the summit , it would be fair to say that it be somewhat late for the House to have such a discussion .however , the Opposition have table an amendment in reasonable term sufficiently criticise those aspect of the Community that we consider worth criticise .we hope that , in the light of the spirit in which it be move , the Government will join we in a common approach to these problem ."
