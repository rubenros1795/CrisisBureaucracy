recently I have the privilege of attend the annual general meeting of my local association for the care of those with spina bifida and hydrocephalus .one realise the particular difficulty with which the parent of child who suffer from these complaint must cope .sometimes bureaucracy be unnecessarily harsh in allocate assistance for adaptation .often a grant will be available , and , where that be not the case , some adaptation qualify for relief from vat .that be right and desirable , but it be extraordinary that VAT relief be available for work do to help access to a property and for the provision or alteration of a bathroom , washroom or lavatory , but not if one wish to build or adapt a bedroom for a disabled person .
