16454-1966-05-16.15.1.94.3-conservative	I draw attention to this sombre and historic fact .one of the great and most powerful attraction to industry and management , and to man who have to consider finance , investment , etc . , be be near to the bureaucracy where the decision be make .for example , France have a very centralised form of government , planning and administration .the effect of this be to draw all industry to Paris and the surround region .

10270-1966-07-26.25.1.9.11-conservative	I want to mention briefly the main omission from the present package .there be nothing to give people incentive ; there be nothing to encourage saving ; there be nothing to encourage efficiency ; there be no promise of economy in Whitehall ; there be nothing to encourage investment against great deflationary pressure ; there be nothing to encourage export , except , perhaps , hotel .here we see a typical example of the Government 's contradictory policy .they penalise all the hotel through the Selective Employment Tax , and now propose to set up a bureaucracy to try to make an administrative judgment on how hotel may help to encourage tourism , and to give they a loan .

22233-1966-08-12.12.1.14.3-conservative	I be not make a party point because this have apply to government of both complexion in this country .it be partly due to bureaucracy and to the fact that this House , in certain direction , do not control as much as it should of its own representation .for example , it be not satisfactory that Parliamentarians , should have to turn to Government Departments for a vote for entertainment .it would be more appropriate for there to be a parliamentary vote , under the control of this sovereign House , for what we , as a body of Parliamentarians , do in entertain our parliamentary friend abroad .

22549-1966-10-18.12.1.31.7-conservative	of course , it be true that , as the conservative lawyer point out , the need for some kind of grievance machinery in the modern world scarcely need to be emphasise .the point at which the individual can come into contact with what he be inclined to call bureaucracy be increase in number , and the consequence to the individual can be extraordinarily grievous , as we all know from our constituency experience , even without the small intention on the part of the Government of the day to harm the individual complain , and sometimes even without their knowledge .therefore , in the multifarious action of authority , grievance machinery of some kind be an essential part of modern administration .

19544-1967-06-13.13.2.5.1-liberal	this seem to be a curious clause to emerge from a party which regard itself as the guardian and custodian of liberty .I understand and sympathise with the object of it , which be to extract licence fee from those who should pay they .to that extent , I applaud it .however , a proposal for the setting up of this highly complicated procedure whereby people without television set be to receive communication and there be to be a large department to ensure that such people be visit regularly , come from the party which constantly talk about the increase in bureaucracy and the number of civil servant —

18935-1968-01-29.17.1.2.1-conservative	I beg to move , that this House deplore the continued growth of bureaucracy and the failure of her Majesty 's Government to announce in their statement on Public Expenditure , Command Paper no .3515 , clear proposal to streamline the machinery of Government and so reduce the number employ in the public service .the most urgent task face Parliament today be to curb the power of central Government and close the ever - widen gap between Whitehall and our constituent .in the last three year , we have see an apparently uncontrollable growth in the number of public servant .whereas between 1951 and 1964 the number of non - industrial civil servant , exclude the Post Office , fall by 11,000 , in the three year between October , 1964 , and October , 1967 , the number rise by no few than 54,000 .this be an increase in the hard core of administrative bureaucracy and represent a rise of about 13 per cent .

17129-1968-01-29.17.1.123.3-conservative	in Britain , we have rightly pride ourselves on possess the good Civil Service and the good civil servant in the world .but , because of Government muddle , our civil servant be — most unjustly — become more and more out of favour with the british people .when the Civil Service become too large and top - heavy , bureaucracy flourish , and it be bureaucratic red tape that stifle private enterprise .
17129-1968-01-29.17.1.135.3-conservative	one wonder sometimes whether the mushroom growth of the Civil Service be not the Prime Minister 's secret weapon for deal with the unemployment problem .I repeat that if he really mean that he be back Britain there be a great deal that he himself can do .he can , for instance , drop some of the legislation that he have in mind for further nationalisation — steel and transport .these measure can only produce inefficiency , waste and extra expense .if he so desire he could cut bureaucracy to a minimum and restore more faith to free people willing to work and make profit not only for themselves but for the country .
21788-1968-01-29.17.1.137.2-labour	I be amazed to learn that local government be overstaffed .I always understand that it be understaffed , and that one of the reason why we be have an inquiry be to examine the need for large unit able to afford the necessary staff of the right calibre .what have be say about government by local authority and what be bureaucratic about it have nothing to do with staffing .it have something to do with the fact that councillor be part time .in the large local authority this mean that official be leave very much to themselves .this in in the nature of thing .I have often tell friend that 1 should have like to see an ombudsman for some large local authority before there be one for the Government service because there be far more check upon the Civil Service nationally than upon local government official .if there be a point about bureaucracy in local authority it be not so much in a wastage of manpower , because a great many of they can not afford the manpower that they should have , but rather in the administration , and that be what should be look at .
18702-1968-01-29.17.1.151.7-liberal	we do not stem bureaucracy by party slogan .bureaucracy be a problem of our time .it be the problem of all country , under all political system .it operate under parliamentary democracy , just as much as under dictatorship .to conquer it we have to understand its nature , and the reason for its development .in theory one can say that bureaucracy be the government of official responsible only to their chief .they be not responsible to the people whose live their decision affect .why do this matter ?one could perhaps say that if it bring about increase efficiency then that be a very good argument in favour of it .as a Liberal the answer be that the individual human personality be supremely valuable and it can flourish only in freedom and true participation in social and individual relationship .Personality be the factor which distinguish a person from a thing .a person have self - direction and can move , but a thing can be move only by other .in a democracy , person be move about by official , they do not move themselves .Bureaucracy make thing of all of we , and limit our freedom to develop our personality .
18702-1968-01-29.17.1.151.8-liberal	this be why liberal want a participate society .Bureaucracy be the very opposite of this .why have bureaucracy increase in all modern society ?one factor be the complexity of modern society which have increase the whole problem of administration , therefore require more people to carry it out .
18702-1968-01-29.17.1.151.9-liberal	another be the general tendency towards centralisation , not only in Government but in business .another be the overcrowding of our society which be give as an explanation for all sort of infringement of liberty .a fourth factor be the inadequacy of democratic institution , and lastly , most dangerous of all , the extraordinary acceptance by ordinary people of this process of grow bureaucracy .
18702-1968-01-29.17.1.151.11-liberal	the second major factor encourage the growth of bureaucracy be that of centralisation .I can remember , in one of those book that one sit up all night swot before the economics degree , there be on one side of the page the di - economy of large scale , and on the other side the economy .unfortunately , modern society seem to have remember only one side of the page , and not the other .I believe that there be considerable di - economy in large - scale production , and one have only to look at British Railways and the Coal Board to realise that we have get to the stage where management can not cope .the problem of administer something as vast and complex as these be beyond mere mortal .the Aberfan Tribunal show this only too clearly .the other problem of centralisation be that people in government be too far remove from the people they be govern .this again create an increase bureaucratic tendency .
18702-1968-01-29.17.1.151.12-liberal	"""the third factor which I mention be overcrowd .I say that it be use as a defence for almost any kind of infringement of liberty and extension of bureaucracy .it may well be that overcrowding will eventually destroy our society .in """" the Naked Ape """" , Desmond Morris report on experiment on the overcrowding of monkey and show how the whole of their social structure disintegrate .I suspect that this may be happen to we in London and be part and parcel of the reason why our mental hospital be get full ."""
18702-1968-01-29.17.1.151.13-liberal	two factor relate to overcrowding be town and country planning and traffic management .here , bureaucracy have run riot .I suppose that the ordinary individual feel that town and country planning legislation infringe his liberty more than almost anything else .some question which I recently ask of the Minister of Housing and Local Government show how long a person have to wait before he can hear the result of his appeal .if he have put in write representation , he have to wait more than half a year—26½week be the average time in 1967 .this be an intolerable wait .if he have a full - scale inquiry with proper evidence , he have to wait 39 week .at the end of it , 78 per cent , of all appeal hear during the period be dismiss .
18702-1968-01-29.17.1.151.14-liberal	traffic management be a classic instance of interference for the sake of interfere .a recent article in the Journal of Transport Economics show that , with all the paraphernalia and street furniture which we have introduce into traffic management in central London , we have achieve nothing .we have reduce the total capacity for traffic in the centre of London and have not increase the speed at which it move .here be an instance of bureaucracy continue on its course and produce no proper result .
18702-1968-01-29.17.1.151.17-liberal	the second point in the reform of government be the bringing of more specialist knowledge to the democratic process where it can match the specialist knowledge of the Civil Service .thirdly , the second Chamber should be reform on democratic line .the right hon .member for Easington ( Mr. Shinwell ) suggest that we need few member of Parliament .that may be a very good idea .but if we be to have few member of Parliament , it might be sensible to have two house share the burden of control the Executive , the Civil Service and the bureaucracy .this be a personal point .I be not state party policy .I do not like the idea of any undemocratic Chamber and I should not want to support any reform which be not democratic in nature .
18702-1968-01-29.17.1.153.3-liberal	local council should be give the power to write their own constitution .why should we have one constitution for local government throughout the country ?why not allow local authority to experiment , as they can in the United States ?it would help if the chief citizen of the town be directly elect .this would give he great power to intervene in bureaucratic decision - making and to represent the people .I would abolish alderman who be thoroughly entrench in bureaucracy .
18702-1968-01-29.17.1.155.1-liberal	they be not elect ; they be appoint .the whole essence of bureaucracy be that the people who be appoint be not responsible to the people whose decision they affect .
18702-1968-01-29.17.1.157.1-liberal	there be a very great danger that in review the size of local government area we shall concentrate merely on their boundary and not pay enough attention to reform the council themselves .merely to increase the size of local government area would be to exacerbate the bureaucracy which we already see around we .
18702-1968-01-29.17.1.157.3-liberal	I come to what I call the most dangerous aspect of bureaucracy — that people be begin to accept great interference in their life .state paternalism be get a hold on we .the attitude seem to be that whenever anything go wrong the State must provide .this be why bureaucracy have grow .there be a great danger of universal acceptance .in the welfare service there will always be matter to which the Government will have to see and service which the Government will have to provide .if we be to go on extend those service which the Government must provide , there must also be service from which the Government must withdraw .if official be to go on be give increase power to interfere in a whole host of service , then bureaucracy will undoubtedly increase and escalate .
18702-1968-01-29.17.1.157.4-liberal	bureaucracy can not be measure in number .we need to discover an entirely new kind of society , a participate society which encourage everyone to play a part in make social decision , and a distibutivist society which distribute not only wealth but power back to the people .there be a danger that our society in the future will be one in which the individual who be worthy of that title will not want to live .
21830-1968-01-29.17.1.159.3-labour	"""for instance , the term """" bureaucracy """" have become a term of derision , and I think the hon .member may have have this in mind .it be a term which be use to express something we be suffer from .yet , when we look at what have be happen in our society and be still happen in our society , we find that the tendency be the reverse of what be customarily take as be the truth .it be not new , this thing which people have have to suffer from .for instance , we can go back to Shakespeare 's day and to Hamlet 's soliloquy when he talk of the law 's delay ,   the insolence of office , and the spurn   that patient merit of the unworthy take , a long time ago , and there be no State that penetrate or seemingly penetrate into every aspect of life in those day ."""
21830-1968-01-29.17.1.167.1-labour	it be a parliamentary term .I submit to this House , and I submit this in all seriousness , that development in recent year have be away from this , so that we suffer less from bureaucracy .although there be , perhaps , very many more people who may be call bureaucrat , we , the ordinary people , suffer less from bureaucracy than ever we suffer in the past .I be not go to say that this be bind to go on , but up to this present stage that be what have be happen .I say that it be a fallacy , this attitude we have towards bureaucracy ; and this be where , though I like very much of what the hon .member for Cornwall , North be try to say , I say he be wrong in his interpretation about what have be happen in our society .hon .member opposite , and most people , perhaps , be wrong when they think they think that government be more remote and get more remote .it be not the case .the Government I support , I say again in all seriousness , be never nearer to the people , though it be not a question of the particular Government I happen to support ; it be a process which have be go on over these past year .
21830-1968-01-29.17.1.169.3-labour	in many way we be somewhat off the rail in discuss so - call bureaucracy .for example , many people have the idea that decentralisation be the answer to all our problem .my colleague who represent scottish constituency know that I do not want to see Scotland give self - government .I be interested in ensure that Scotland have a say here , in the British House of Commons .indeed , many of our fellow english hon .member need a Scots voice or two to guide they .I want to protect our right to be here and I do not want to be shunt off to anywhere else , not even the Scottish Grand Committee .I want our problem air right here .
21830-1968-01-29.17.1.169.4-labour	some people have the idea that , in the interest of democracy , there should be more decentralisation .however , few hon .member will deny that there be more bureaucracy — perhaps of a somewhat objectionable nature — at the local authority level than there be within the Civil Service .the other day a fellow appear on television and say that he be the Town Clerk of Tarbolton , no doubt an important place , and that he be pay 5s .a year for his job .I be sure that he be an excellent fellow , but it do not follow that he be any less bureaucratic than a local official receive many thousand of £ s a year .

-1968-01-29.17.1.175.1-na	I have a sneak admiration for those hon .member opposite who have drift in during the afternoon and have try to put up a spirited defence of what I believe to be an absolutely indefensible case .only one hon .member opposite who have speak be here early to hear the magnificent speech of my right hon .and learn Friend the Member for Hexham ( Mr. Rippon ) .judge by what I have hear they say , the debate would have have more point have they hear he .one thing that have worry I more than anything else that I have hear from the Government bench be the defeatist attitude of hon .member — an air of the inevitability of the continue growth of bureaucracy .this be at the bottom of the Government 's difficulty , and it be one that they will face increasingly as long as they remain the Government .
-1968-01-29.17.1.175.3-na	comparison be make with industry , particularly by my neighbour , the hon .member for Edinburgh , East ( Mr. Willis ) .he say that big business also suffer from inefficiency of one kind or another which cause waste .that may be true , but the point be that most industry and business have to survive in a competitive world and can not afford to indulge in waste .on the other hand , the Government and the bureaucracy be in a slightly different position .they do not have the competition that keep other people on their toe , and they do not have shareholder insist on the business be manage efficiently .
-1968-01-29.17.1.177.2-na	the present growth of bureaucracy be not inevitable .it be very often the direct result of certain policy , some of which we think be very bad and other of which we may support .we should not accept the theory of inevitability , as hon .member opposite do .much of the increase be the price we have to pay for Socialism , and in this connection Selective Employment Tax be a good example .
-1968-01-29.17.1.179.3-na	I make two suggestion to try to cope with the problem as I see they .it be not good enough to aim simply to contain the growth of bureaucracy .we must aim to introduce cut and reduction by transfer civil servant to productive industry .practically all big industry and business do not hesitate to make use of business consultancy and business efficiency firm to advise they .I see no stigma attach to this .I see no reason why the Civil Service should not use outside business consultant .my respect for the Roman Catholic Church be greatly enhance when it undergo this sort of examination .I be most interested when it come out equal to Standard Oil , New Jersey .
-1968-01-29.17.1.183.2-na	in deplore the growth of bureaucracy , I also express disappointment at the performance of the last Government in not prune the Civil Service a great deal more than they do .but to look at the achievement of the present Government by which they have make the Civil Service our big growth industry , be agonising .for this reason , I have the great pleasure in support the Motion in the name of my right hon .friend .
16615-1968-01-29.17.1.187.2-labour	I should be the last to agree that every man on the employment rôle , whether in the Civil Service or in private industry , should always for eight hour a day be do a job .industry must carry spare labour , to cope with emergency and for all sort of reason .it must carry skilled man for breakdown .it just can not run its production machine 100 per cent , full - out with all its labour force employ .in every function , no matter what it be , labour must be available for emergency of all kind , whether in a small enterprise or a large enterprise , whether in the State sector or in private industry .when talk about bureaucracy and the growth of manpower in the Civil Service , it should be remember that there have be a growth in manpower in practically every industry .

Campbell ) , I point out that clause 68(2 ) ( b ) , deal with a control journey , cover a transport service , not only one journey .it may be a pattern of journey on a regular basis accord to the particular give to the licensing authority .I assure the hon .member that the conception embody in the Statute be that a licensing authority can consider a whole pattern of journey , include back load and back journey .this would reduce any necessity for bureaucracy so long as the licensing authority be satisfied on the basis of speed , reliability and cost that the good should go by road .
22072-1968-05-29.9.1.70.2-conservative	we be disappoint with the Minister 's remark .the difference between we be sum up when the hon .Gentleman say that the Government 's attitude be that they want the minimum of exception to quantity licensing .we on this side want to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy .we can not see why we should have a system under which , for example , people in a part of Scotland where there be no railway go through the process constantly when they suddenly want to send good for more than 100 mile .they will have to make this sort of application , well know that they will get approval , and this be completely unnecessary .the reason why the Western Isles and the island be exempt be that they do not possess railway , and the Government obviously consider that it would be a complete waste of time to put they through the process .
22072-1968-05-29.9.1.72.2-conservative	Amendment no .265 would result in considerable area of Scotland and other locality be save the appalling bureaucracy that quantity licensing involve .the people in the area would know that they can invest in lorry and other vehicle and how they can organise their transport .
22072-1968-05-30.2.1.27.4-conservative	this Bill have be steamroller through Parliament .the effect of it will be to add to the cost of living , to handicap the efficiency of the transport system , to increase bureaucracy and nationalisation .it have all the basic ingredient of a thoroughly bad piece of socialist legislation .I very much regret that any Government face with the economic problem that face this Government should decide in this Session of all Sessions to have as their major piece of legislation , a Bill which have so many adverse effect on the economy as a whole .we will probably have further debate on this because we know that amendment will be move in another place .the Government have already list a number of matter concern which they will try to move amendment .we will probably welcome most of those amendment .possibly other amendment may accompany they .
16530-1968-05-30.2.1.35.2-conservative	throughout the Committee stage I be chiefly concerned with the licensing provision , and it be on that part of the Bill that I should like to speak now .it be monstrous that this part of the Committee stage be so ruthlessly guillotine , for this mean that many aspect of both quality and quantity licensing be never properly discuss .the whole question of quality licensing be not very contentious , and the Opposition 's purpose throughout the Committee stage be to try to keep the red tape and bureaucracy down to the minimum .
22503-1968-05-30.15.2.38.11-conservative	my last : objection be that the acquisition of equity capital mean , above all , State control .it mean nationalisation by the dack door .it mean the very process which have bring our country into its present difficult pass .it mean a process — as we know on the railway , and in other respect — of large loss , bad service , high taxis , and a vast bureaucracy .these be the thing to which the Government 's proposal will condemn our country , and their lordship have see the wisdom of send to this House a short , sharp amendment to knock out this disease from our midst .
18340-1968-06-19.6.11.4.1-labour	the present position under the Transport Bill save a great deal of bureaucracy , in that it release something like 100,000 vehicle from licensing .the difference between we be that the dutch system , which be basically what be be propose here , would present information but in the last resort the consignor could still stick to road transport in the face of all the evidence that rail be just as good .

19108-1969-12-10.16.1.42.2-labour	I have enjoy the debate , but I have not always be enthral to that degree which from time to time I be and which the hon .member for Worcester ( Mr. Peter ' Walker ) think I should be .the impression be give of bureaucracy malevolently work in Whitehall to produce a complex scheme to baffle the public and hamstring trader , but I must put on record straight away that this be far from be the picture .the pressure for change have come from almost everywhere but the Government .
17288-1969-12-11.14.1.28.16-conservative	from a study of the clause relate to the part of the Bill with which I be deal , it seem that the area board will have very little effective power leave to they .they will be keep in name only , and even small decision affect their area will undoubtedly come to be take in London .I say this because , have create these new department at the centre , a bureaucracy will inevitably be set up at the centre .this will mean that the decision of the area board affect their interest will be take not necessarily at board meeting level — I be not worried about that ; I accept that the 12 board will be represent and will have a say at the centre — but far down the line in term of operational reality .in other word , decision will be take not by man at board level but by man at the centre whose decision will have a direct effect on the interest of the area board .
19729-1969-12-11.14.1.54.2-labour	the Opposition 's argument be not new .the first criticism of the Bill by the hon .member for Bournemouth , West ( Sir J.

14204-1969-12-18.9.1.34.1-labour	I quote from Lloyd 's list of 17th December : it would be easy enough for the Conservative Party 's eager spokesman to make plenty of fire - breathing speech about local autonomy , centralised bureaucracy and full unfettered enterprise during the debate on the Bill .but before he do so , he might be well advise to listen to the port employer , and find out just how the man who actually have to run the port think their job could most efficiently be do .

21900-1969-12-18.9.1.109.4-conservative	the next not unimportant point raise by the hon .member for Poplar be the question of paper work .I agree with he .paper work be the most significant form of grit in the modern commercial machine .the International Chamber of Commerce at its recent meeting in Turkey set up several committee to deal with this , and these have produce a number of interesting report .a very considerable effort be be make by large number of organisation , private , governmental and international , to deal with this question , which it be a concentration of all the fiery heat of bureaucracy of all kind in one great overwhelming burden on commerce .we know that the matter be extremely difficult to put right and I would remind the hon .member for Poplar that two of the most serious and time - comsume form of paper work which international commerce have to bear be those impose by Customs and Government .therefore the obligation , which he have rightly describe as fall everywhere , fall equally on the public sector .
10591-1969-12-18.9.1.137.2-conservative	it have be say that this change in ownership will bring with it certain advantage .what be be propose be simply put the State in place of group of public authority , in some case municipal enterprise , and in one case a privately - own authority .they will be bring together , and the state will be the control factor instead of various local body .this will create more problem , and more bureaucracy .what be more important , it be pointless , and it will destroy what local interest and concern there be in many of these area .

21752-1970-02-10.12.1.15.7-conservative	in our view , it be essential that great care should be take to avoid a build - up of unnecessary and wasteful bureaucracy in the operation of the board .it be equally essential for everyone concerned to be convince that the levy - grant system be operate fairly and reasonably .self - criticism be not always see to be a virtue by the training board , and more of it might be helpful .there should be a continuous evaluation of their work and performance , encourage by the right hon .Lady and her Department .the opportunity for a review have be miss today by the Government .however , I can give industry and those who be worried about the situation the assurance that the next Conservative Government will look closely into these question , if the present government fail to act in due course .

16699-1970-02-20.4.1.14.13-conservative	I also have reservation about the introduction of the Registrar of Friendly Societies .at present , the Inland Revenue and the Registrar of Non - Participating Employments be involve in such scheme , and I hope that we can avoid the introduction of a third body , so as to cut out as much paperwork and bureaucracy as possible in achieve the main objective of see that the fund be in order , and enable member to have a fair statement of their position and to know that their pension be secure within the limit that it be practicable to achieve .if we have too many registrar , there be a danger of too many cook and too much expense and uncertainty .

18286-1970-02-24.7.1.230.7-conservative	I believe that Britain inside Europe , to use the shorthand phrase , as it be , will prove to be a very good european .that will happen because of our respect for law ; because of our practice of democracy ; because of our insistence on bureaucracy be bring under democratic control .our follow through with british tradition inside Europe will help to ensure that Europe be the sort of Europe we want — a democratic Europe .in the process , that will also help the unity of the continent .
19374-1970-02-25.11.1.40.3-conservative	why be that ?I think there be a certain significance in the fact that in its supplement last Thursday the Daily Telegraph print an article by an ex - political leader on this very matter .he say : be we go into Europe now to make a proper job of it , or will Britain shrink back in timid isolation ?he go on : Europe will not work without a large measure of common government .that be write by Sir Oswald Mosley , the ex - leader of the British Union of Fascists , and that be really the clue to the repugnance of many british people about Britain 's inclusion in the Community .they do not want to be subject to an authoritarian bureaucracy , and they believe that that would be the answer if we go into the Community .
21704-1970-02-26.8.1.47.7-labour	thirdly , I should like to comment on my right hon .friend 's rather sheepish remark about insist on it be a statutory committee while Maud and everybody else say that we should not have any statutory committee .the experience of anyone who have be in local government be that statutory committee be a frightful nuisance .when when law state that there must be a statutory committee , it be often an invitation to bureaucracy , because the committee have to be hedge around with decision - take power , which usually mean enormous delay in decision - taking , and the decision - taking be by the wrong people .
21704-1970-02-26.8.1.49.2-labour	have make one or two criticism of the Bill , may I say that I give it a hearty welcome .I think that it could represent an enormous advance in the attitude of local authority to people in the community .the ordinary man in the street often look on his local authority as a bit of awful bureaucracy , as a housing office , or as a rather grim town hall in which he have to search around to find the right place to go .when he come with his social problem he be often confront with someone who be fundamentally a clerical officer .
22085-1970-03-02.8.1.81.3-conservative	but now , much duplication be involve which be wasteful of our scarce skilled medical resource .so , although I normally disapprove of any increase in bureaucracy , in this case I see a lot of sense in appoint a small number of medical officer cover a wide function to replace the much large number — my hon .friend say 1,500 — of part - time factory doctor engage on routine medical examination .
22555-1970-03-19.20.1.3.2-labour	but this be not just a question of a speed limit on a road .it involve an important principle : the relation between national and local government .it be the old argument of whether Whitehall know good .the proposal to increase the speed limit from 30 m.p.h .have become a decision since I lose the original Adjournment debate .we be talk , therefore , about a decision rather than a proposal and an example of bureaucracy at its bad .I will outline the event which lead I to have to raise this tonight .

21659-1970-03-24.11.3.92.1-conservative	the new clause , for all its obscurity — it be very complex — be clearly about capital .as I say in Committee , capital be the life blood of this or any other industry in our capitalist society , so this be one of the most important clause in the Bill .it be intend to improve efficiency and cut bureaucracy and , I assume , make life easy for farmer and civil servant .it be difficult to discuss this in detail , since we do not know the exact provision of the Statutory Instrument , but I do not see how a general levelling - off in grant will improve efficiency .it will , I suppose , be easy if there be only one form to take out of the drawer , but it be bind to be a complex piece of paper , contain an enormous number of question .it may turn out to be more complicated than some of the present form .
19526-1970-03-26.11.1.2.20-labour	the third thing that disturb I relate to the process by which administrative decision be take .it be far too often assume that a benevolent bureaucracy must take decision which be in the interest of the individual citizen .it be important if decision be take affect individual citizen that those person should be persuade of the rightness of those decision .I have by now a very good knowledge of Mr. and Mrs. Gamble and I have not find they unreasonable people .I be convinced that , if they be persuade that there be no alternative but a complete shattering of their dream for Janice 's education , nevertheless , they would accept the situation .
16426-1970-04-06.5.1.72.1-labour	may I first make one or two comment on the speech of the hon .member for the Isle of Ely ( Sir H.

22237-1971-11-03.6.1.128.3-labour	the next disaster be that of the common agricultural policy to which this Government have say that we shall ally ourselves .but what do the E.E.C.find when it produce a 12 per cent .increase in grain production , as have be achieve in this harvest year ?it find that it can not foot the bill which it have say it must foot .neither can it pay the subsidy and grant which it undertake to pay .what do we get ?we be accept a policy which , the moment it move from scarcity to sufficiency , produce more problem than it know how to solve .since 15th August any belief that the common agricultural policy have commonalty or be a policy have become pure moonshine .it no long exist , and where it try to exist it emerge as the most baneful product of the Brussels bureaucracy yet produce .
18728-1971-11-03.6.1.150.8-labour	other hon .member have refer to other institution , but I will switch very quickly to a point of view express by my right hon .friend the Member for Kettering ( Sir G. de Freitas ) , who talk about a European Parliament .he ask for guarantee .I think that he have a valid argument .he be a sincere European and I have already respect his view .he believe that we should have a proper parliamentary check on the European Commission — that it must not be like the Assembly at Strasbourg , which he and I use to attend .but the Commission be the main body in Europe , even though there be a Council of Ministers .in a European Parliament we should be able to have 36 member , and my right hon .friend be concerned because inevitably we should have constituency as large as 1,500,000 people .he therefore ask for certain assurance .he may have faith in this sort of system , but I have not .all I can see in Europe at the moment be a vast european bureaucracy .
18728-1971-11-03.6.1.152.1-labour	I admire my hon .friend 's optimism .all I can say be that only one policy be emerge .I have criticise it , but it be the only policy , and there be a vast bureaucracy .even one of the Commissioners — the German Commissioner , Professor Dahrendorf — have attack the bureaucracy in the Community .there be no effective parliamentary check .
18728-1971-11-03.6.1.154.2-labour	entry into the European Economic Community , with the establishment of the bureaucracy that we now see and the concept of create a European Parliament in the absence of a federal system , which be what it really mean , will weaken and frustrate our own democratic procedure and will not solve the fundamental problem that I have mention — such as employment — and those affect the great industry for which I once have the honour to have responsibility .
17091-1971-11-08.10.1.5.10-labour	it be not only that this rebate be wrong in principle but it also present most formidable practical drawback .the increase in bureaucracy — in the number of rent officer and local authority staff — especially to deal with the gigantic task of administer private rent allowance — go quite counter to all the Government 's pledge about reduce civil service manpower , and it will be interesting to hear what tory back bencher think about that .again , there be the probability of low take - up because people be too proud or too stubborn or too ignorant or find it all too complicated — we can see the pattern from experience of the F.I.S.and rebate scheme in London and Birmingham .
19096-1971-11-08.10.1.97.17-labour	this will be an enormous job call for an enormous bureaucracy .the Government say that a small increase in manpower will be require .that be nonsense .it be the understatement of the year .an enormous team of bureaucrat will be need to assess the rent .rent officer and rent assessment committee will be need to check the rent rebate form .People will have to assess the new council rate .there will be an enormous increase in Civil Service and local government manpower to deal with this crazy scheme whose sole object be to shift the burden of expenditure from the taxpayer to the council tenant .
18562-1971-11-10.5.32.1.1-conservative	on a point of order .be it possible , Mr. Speaker , for you to intervene and use your good office to protect minority interest among private member of this House who seek week after week to reach obscure Ministers who be set low down on the answering list for question ?be you aware , Sir , that for week past we have be try to reach the Minister for the Civil Service — the Minister for the bureaucracy — and that today we have again be frustrate by the garrulous and loquacious behaviour of the Scots , who take 45 minute to deal with 20 question , which I could have deal with from the Front Bench in a quarter of that time ?
18562-1971-11-10.5.32.1.2-conservative	as we now have to put up with write reply from the Minister for the bureaucracy , and from the Minister for Posts and Telecommunications on such important matter as the future of the Post Office Giro , on which there be wide - spread support for my view that it should be abolish , will not you , Mr. Speaker , take appropriate action to see that private member can question all Ministers in rotation , and that this acute selectivity be not continue to the detriment of silent member of the House such as myself ?
22118-1971-11-11.3.4.3.1-conservative	do my hon .friend agree that many company within the industry be not happy with the present structure and organisation , and that to impose this form of bureaucracy upon those small company be hardly consistent with the Government 's attitude towards ease the position of the small company ?
16494-1971-11-15.3.27.3.1-labour	would the hon .Gentleman accept my congratulation on administer this field at obviously a very small expense ?be he aware that the Government be seek to argue that an international authority to administer exploitation of the sea bed would entail much bureaucracy ?would he agree that the figure he have just quote show that it would do nothing of the kind ?
22072-1971-11-16.16.1.12.4-conservative	the other 300 further control which I be consider with my Department and with other Government department we may be able either to abolish or to amend .at the end of the passage of this legislation , and legislation which will follow from other Departments in the foreseeable future , there will be a very substantial reduction in these individual control .many of they have result in an absurd unnecessary bureaucracy be create .for example , it have be the duty of Ministers in the past to approve ferry fare charge by local authority and to approve burial fee and the fee of various market .I do not believe that people in Whitehall be particularly good at fix matter like this which would be much well leave to local discretion .
17162-1971-11-16.16.1.61.7-labour	we should eliminate , or at least greatly reduce , the remoteness between the citizen and his local authority .we must make local government as local as possible .we must have less bureaucracy and more democracy .
21822-1971-11-16.16.1.82.4-labour	I have say before that I do not favour large all - purpose authority .they add to remote control .they detract from local control and local interest and they increase the threat of local bureaucracy .therefore , I can not wholeheartedly agree with the change propose in this legislation or , to be frank , those in the Maud Report .
21914-1971-11-16.16.1.86.6-labour	secondly , a multiplicity of small council will disappear .these have be a hive of bumble bureaucracy in the past , despite many line public servant with whom we have work in harness , particularly the clerk of rural district council who have many fine housing achievement .I see this change as essentially a process of area merger , mainly on a county basis .it be imperative that we should get out of the exist situation in which our city be throttle by too much urbanisation and that monster the motor car .we want change .we have change our dwell habit and our social behaviour and , in my view , the two - tier system of county council and county district will meet many of the difficulty .
21889-1971-11-30.11.1.99.1-labour	the hon .member be one of the good example of those who make these usual cheap comment about bureaucracy .
22127-1971-11-30.14.1.2.13-conservative	I be not suggest that a great new bureaucracy should be set up and instal in office there .but we have the Historic Buildings Council , the National Buildings Record , the Royal Commission on Historic Monuments , great private institution like the National Trust , the Civic Trust , the Government 's Countryside Commission , all the learn society , the Historic Houses Committee of the tourist authority , society concern with conservation , the C.P.R.E. , the S.P.A.B.
22127-1971-11-30.14.1.2.15-conservative	I be sure the Government would not want to create a new bureaucracy , but they would , by dedicate Somerset House to this new purpose , enable the art and all of those who try to help they to flourish .the new role of this great place should be allow to evolve in the next few year , and perhaps by the time of the bicentenary it could be play a significant part in our national and international life .here , of course , we have an enormous responsibility and a great opportunity as we look towards Europe .Britain could lead the way in european cultural appreciation .
18562-1971-12-01.4.1.1.1-conservative	on a point of order .you will recall , Mr. Speaker , that several week ago I ask for your protection for the Sassenach majority in this House from the garrulous behaviour of the Scots .on every occasion that the Minister for the bureaucracy be set down to answer question at no .35 , he be not reach because the Scots occupy such an inordinate length of time with their question .will you now take step to protect the Sassenach majority and , by arrangement with the Leader of the House , see to it that the Minister for the bureaucracy be move so that he answer question begin at no .20 , so that at least once every six month hon .member may reach he ?
17657-1971-12-03.4.1.41.8-labour	I be worried about what my hon .friend refer to as the thin end of the wedge .to impose a charge on the borrower would introduce the thin end of the wedge of library charge , and we should become involved in the most bureaucratic nonsense we have ever know .there be enough bureaucratic nonsense already involve in the museum charge .I speak as a trustee of the National Maritime Museum , which be face with the most idiotic bureaucracy , to the extent of have to put railing round the museum because it abut on a public park .how daft can we get ?I be frightened that similar bureaucratic nonsense will result if we lightly rush into charge for the borrowing of book from library .
22118-1971-12-07.7.1.65.18-conservative	there be a feeling in the South - West that we do not have either the ear or the understanding of Whitehall and Bristol .People need a lead , and they be look for one .if , therefore , there be a genuine South - west economic development council , it would serve the need of an area which require some form of assistance .let we remember that the fundamental purpose of regionalism be not only to provide more economic activity and to act as a brake on centralised bureaucracy , but also to establish in our region a genuine association between man , decision - making and local life .
19314-1971-12-07.7.1.89.2-conservative	I urge the Minister to do what he can to move office from London out to the province .we have superb office clerical labour on Merseyside .we also have comparatively cheap office accommodation which be ready for occupation .if there be to be a big bureaucracy follow entry into Europe , let part of that staff he situate in the North - West or in the North .
19152-1971-12-09.19.1.16.2-labour	this point , raise several time , highlight the power this House have de jure but which the Government be slide round de facto .I have be in this House for only just over a year , but I have to tell those who have be here long that the public be get feed up with bureaucracy of all sort .it be a grow problem in the country at almost every level .delegate legislation be one of the great growth industry of the lot .it be not new and it behove any Government to treat such legislation with the utmost care if the power of Parliament be to remain as strong — and it need to be just as strong if not strong in future in the condition we face , industrially , economically and socially — as it have be in the past .we have to be ultra - careful about these matter .I understand that this order be technically in order despite the note which tell we that the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments have not yet complete its consideration of the Instrument .this be a distinct loophole in the Standing Orders of the House .I hope that when the Select Committee on Procedure look at this , it will take note of the loophole that have apparently appear as a result of this order .
19173-1971-12-14.10.1.69.8-conservative	first , it would lead to a constant inquisition into the Sovereign 's financial affair , which be undesirable .second , it would lead to great inefficiency , not to great efficiency ; it would substitute for a small bureaucracy act on the scene a large bureaucracy away from it .therefore , the operation would be more expensive , not less expensive .third , it would be an unconstitutional innovation in the sense that it would run counter to a fundamental principle of our constitution .
21742-1971-12-16.16.1.33.8-conservative	thirdly , we want a sharpening of decision - making throughout the nationalise side of the industry .the corporation be still far from achieve the excellent ideal with which it begin of make individual responsible and clearly accountable .compare with the time before nationalisation , line manager feel far from the point where decision be take .decision seem to come from the machine , not from identifiable human being .this be one of the snag of nationalise any industry .in a large industry it be bind to set up some kind of bureaucracy .the least we can do be to make sure that it be efficient bureaucracy .we be still far short of that in the steel industry .
17551-1971-12-17.3.1.11.7-conservative	considerable sum of money be spend block the view of passenger to the outside world .I be tell that this be because it be feel that if people could look into the arrival lounge they would see Customs officer go through the luggage of passenger .in fact , in terminal 3 screen have be put round the bench where the Customs officer inspect passenger ' luggage .behind the compartment where the Customs officer work , large frost glass screen have be erect to block the view of passenger or those meet they .this seem shortsighted and wrong .it be bureaucracy go mad .surely we want people to be able to see their friend when they come to meet they .
18728-1971-12-20.14.1.31.4-labour	it be not the time today to argue about the future rôle of the House and of individual member .no doubt a modern Bagehot will emerge and with distinctive eloquence produce another great classic on our Constitution .I will only assert again that more than ever do we need a strong House of Commons , and need to check and probe the Executive , to expose the bumbling of bureaucracy , to participate more in legislative function , to remedy grievance , and above all , to express the desire and ideal of the british people .
21792-1971-12-21.15.1.20.3-conservative	I do not want to be out of order by go into this particular question at great length .but , personally , I be not attract by the propose solution for two main reason .though myself a bureaucrat by training , and perhaps by nature as well , I do not believe in bureaucracy for the sake of bureaucracy .I also suspect that in accordance with Parkinson 's Law bureaucracy be liable to escalate and so cost more ; and I rather feel that some of the proposal put forward by the right hon .Gentleman would have that effect almost immediately .after all , however loyal we may be we be not try to increase the cost of the Monarchy .I be glad for my part to observe that in the evidence submit to the Select Committee there be no trace of Parkinson 's Law or its effect , and I do not believe one could have examine any Department of the Crown and come to the conclusion that the same work , or rather considerably more work , be be do by the same number of people for very much the same reward as be be do 20 year before .
22529-1972-01-17.10.1.3.11-conservative	I want to relieve farmer wherever possible of the interference of bureaucracy , and in its modest way this measure will help progress in this direction .but the Government be also ready to play their full part in resolve the major question with the leader of the farmer ' union who be rightly bring they to the attention of the House and the country , particularly this week .
18728-1972-01-17.10.1.23.12-labour	I can understand the Minister 's approach .I always admire the right hon .gentleman for his frankness , which get he into difficulty .but I can never understand how he or the Government can square it with their defence of the manage market , support buying , a rigid import levy system and , above all , the creation of a vast bureaucracy in Brussels .the Minister talk about free the british farmer from bureaucracy .
18728-1972-01-17.10.1.27.1-labour	I do not see why I should regret it .after all , a commissioner in the Community , Professor Dahrendorf , have condemn this bureaucracy in speech and in article .one only have to look at some of the regulation which have emerge and see how they be to be implement if we enter the Community .I merely say that the right hon .Gentleman be a passionate admirer of this system , and I can not square it with the view that he have express today and his action in connection with this Bill .

10446-1972-01-17.10.1.53.4-labour	as I have indicate , I want to deal with milk and milk marketing and some of the great uncertainty and query which remain in this vital part of the industry .when the Minister say that he want to free the agricultural industry from bureaucracy , bear in mind the bureaucracy of the Common Market in which we shall perhaps find ourselves shortly , one realise that he be in danger of again make himself a laugh stock in the industry .in Wales milk be the mainstay of the return to the industry , and that have not come about by accident .it have come about deliberately .during the war year one see the milk churn go high and high up the hill and farmer become more and more dependent on milk for their income .everyone know that once a farmer start to produce milk , once he start to be tie to a regular monthly milk cheque , it be exceedingly difficult for he , give the amount of resource available to the industry and the amount of acreage that be available , to get out of it .this part of the industry be genuinely concerned about what will happen to many important facet of the pricing arrangement for milk if we enter the Common Market .
21654-1972-01-17.10.1.69.7-labour	there be some talk early in the debate about the bureaucracy of the agricultural institution of the European Economic Community .we be concerned not just about the bureaucracy of the Common Market .for throughout farming in this country , there be those who be increasingly concerned about the remoteness of policy - making and decision - making affect the industry .they know that in future they will be even more remote from the place where the most important decision be make .

22518-1972-01-17.14.1.14.2-conservative	I want to reiterate two of the point make by the hon .Gentleman and one make by my hon .friend .it be essential that as soon as possible — I know that it be not easy because it cover such a wide front and there be so many intricate part to it — we should have the tidying up which my hon .friend say he have in mind .I do not think that it be fair to ask for any great detail than that at this stage .the fact that it be make clear that it be under consideration and be be look at with a view to something come out at the end of the sausage machine should leave we reasonably satisfied at this stage , provide we can he assure that it will be deal with as speedily as the bureaucracy behind it will allow .
18724-1972-01-21.12.1.2.13-labour	there be also a shocking amount of red tape and bureaucracy in existence .I give just one example of the sort of attitude which be encounter .a resident doctor who occupy single quarter in a hospital recently become ill . his wife move in for two night to nurse he during the illness and to save the hospital staff the chore involve .at the end of the month the doctor receive a bill for two night 's bed and breakfast for his wife this kind of treatment of professional man be indefensible .what be need be a complete demolition job on the present negotiating hierarchy for junior hospital doctor .at the moment the system rest with the toppest of top people in the c.c.h.m.s.

18893-1972-02-03.8.1.24.5-labour	what be certain be that it be not public ownership in the sense in which we use the expression in this House , even if at the time of a General Election it become rather broad in meaning .but it be part of a huge State bureaucracy , and although we on this side of the House agree with the Home Secretary that there be a place for a totalisator board along the line of the organisation set up originally by a Private Member 's Bill in 1928 and , for that reason , we shall not oppose the Bill 's Second Reading , that do not mean that we do not have grave doubt about important part .of the Bill .we shall try to improve ' the Bill in Committee .that will be the tone of our discussion .
18893-1972-02-03.8.1.24.7-labour	we on this side of the House be in favour of public ownership of a variety of different kind .but we be very wary of state bureaucracy and of give organisation power for which there be no responsibility to the Minister or to this House .surely there ought to be some responsibility .I hope that we shall be tell how this work .the Select Committee 's Report say that the Home Secretary have no control over the board 's policy and activity .if that be so , what do the Home Office do in this sense inside the Department ?
10396-1972-02-11.5.1.58.13-liberal_democrats	I do not see how we be to take advantage of these fund without an organisation like the corporation propose .it be plainly undesirable that every scheme for reconversion of old industry should have to be vet by the international bureaucracy itself .
18675-1972-02-15.13.1.72.10-labour	secondly , I believe that Britain in Europe could have an important contribution to make in term of democracy .here I agree with a great deal of what be say by the hon .member for Cheltenham .opponent of british entry point to the Community 's bureaucracy .they rightly point to the democratic weakness of the institution of the Community .they be right to do so .they seem to think that we have in Brussels an inflexible , unchanging situation , whereas I believe that Britain in Europe could bring an important and powerful influence to bear in improve the institution of the Community .here again , I do not believe that we can entrust this operation to a Government which in the process of take Britain into Europe have show such disdain for this Parliament .
19374-1972-02-16.8.1.49.12-conservative	one matter which be of urgent importance to the people of this country be that the House of Commons should be able to discuss the agricultural contribution .I ask the Government — this be well within their sphere of influence — to consider how so to arrange the procedure of the House that those matter which appear to be no long the responsibility of Ministers but of the Commission can be debate in the House both on Opposition day — which use to be call Supply day — and also on the Consolidated Fund Bill .I have no doubt that on many occasion , if we enter the European Community , we shall wish to complain about the bureaucracy of Brussels and its damaging effect on the interest of our constituent .
17919-1972-02-16.8.1.85.3-labour	such a system be literally bureaucracy .it mean not just a loss of sovereignty or of parliamentary Government .it place the power of legislation and taxation — the power to issue decree with legal force — in the hand of an unelected body of official , something which have not be do in Britain since the 17th century .it offend the democratic fundamental principle that people should not be coerce by law in which they have not have even an indirect hand in make .

18728-1972-02-16.8.1.134.2-labour	the Executive and Administration be subject only to limited check .the Parliamentary Assembly in the Community at this stage be only an advisory body .this be what we must bear in mind when examine the Bill , the regulation , the secondary legislation the document and treaty flow from it .no wonder Professor Dahrendorf the distinguished West German Commissioner criticise the weakness of this aspect of the Community 's structure .no wonder over a period of time he have inveigh against the bureaucracy there .we will have to consider this carefully .

17516-1972-03-15.8.3.42.5-labour	I turn briefly to the subject of Amendment No .31 , on the exchange of letter .I shall confine my remark to the exchange of letter on monetary question , begin on page 107 of the document on the Treaty of Accession .this be a remarkable exchange of letter .if my secretary have be responsible for conduct my correspondence in the way in which the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg exchange theirs , I do not think that I should have get much work do .the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster write a long and detailed letter to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg and back come the reply of M. Thorn to the Chancellor of the Duchy : your Excellency ,   you be good enough to make the follow communication to I in your letter of today 's date : then he merely repeat the whole of the letter .that seem to I an extraordinary way of do business .the only thing that he do say be , please accept , your Excellency , the assurance of my high consideration .if we be go to conduct our correspondence with Community Ministers in that way we shall have a deluge of paper and time - waste bureaucracy hitherto unknown even in this country .

17605-1972-04-26.11.1.111.4-liberal	first , I should like to reiterate some thing which have be say about statistic and agricultural service generally .we have over the year build up a satisfactory and fairly complete series of agricultural statistic , which many farmer now begin to understand .they complain about the form , but at any rate they be moderately familiar with they .it would be an irritation , and possibly a pointer to an undue amount of bureaucracy within the Community , if we be force for no particular reason to add to our exist statistic another mass which the Commission may require or to change our method .
17605-1972-04-26.11.1.111.5-liberal	I think that the Conservative Government 's first view of bureaucracy be on the whole rather well than their present view , which appear to be to say that they will cut down the number of civil servant but then to cut down slightly the number of most of the useful one while greatly increase the number of the useless .

18562-1972-05-09.15.1.82.1-conservative	I shall deal in a moment with this question of the increase in bureaucracy , because it be greatly exaggerated in the context of vat .what I object to be the proliferation of unnecessary Government official brew up tea , occupy office space , and so on .I do not think there need necessarily be any huge increase in bureaucracy arise directly from VAT .
18562-1972-05-09.15.1.92.2-conservative	I now propose to say something about the allegation that VAT will create an enormous fiscal bureaucracy both in Government Departments and in industry , trade and commerce .that be possibly true at the time of Richardson and his report , but it be not true today .every workshop , every office and every account department of every firm of any size have calculate machinery readily available .the fact that VAT be calculate on each invoice be of no consequence at all give adequate electronic and other type of office machinery to deal with it .
18562-1972-05-09.15.1.94.2-conservative	the number of bureaucrat , as they have be call , require to operate vat have be grossly exaggerated .the SET system be cumbersome , wasteful and have create thousand of new job for collect relatively small sum of revenue , especially have regard to the repayment , part - time worker , old - age pensioner and other facility .as yet we have no reliable estimate of how many people will be save on set alone , and they all have to be set against the hypothetical increase in the bureaucracy arise from the introduction of vat .

18562-1972-05-10.14.1.94.1-conservative	on the subject of the bureaucracy and fish and chip , the hon .gentleman miss the point .an essential ingredient in the consumption of fish and chip all over Britain be a generous douching with Worcestershire sauce which be zero - rate as a foodstuff .therefore , no value add tax ultimately accrue to the fish and chip shop proprietor for the Worcestershire sauce ingredient .
17516-1972-05-10.14.1.183.11-labour	it would be interesting to know whether the Treasury , which have all along be say that one of the great advantage of a single rate system be the reduction in the number of civil servant who would be need compare with a multiple rate system , have make any calculation of the extra number of civil servant who will be need to operate the various type of multiple rate system .we have have the bland assertion time after time that if we go for more than one rate , ignore zero - rating , we could greatly increase administrative cost , particularly in the bureaucracy .however , we have not have any figure give to we .
21969-1972-05-24.11.1.20.9-conservative	but then one reflect that this be all about directive .suppose there be a regulation which impose or increase taxation , or which create a new criminal offence of this character ?schedule 2 do not bite on regulation .it do not bite on subsection ( 1 ) of clause 2 .we should be present , if this be the case , with an intolerable anomaly , the paradox that the Government of this country could not legislate by regulation in order to impose or increase taxation or to create these criminal offence , but a bureaucracy outside this country could do so without let or hindrance — the paradox that our own Government would need to legislate if they want these power , but , of course , if these power be give by the method of regulation — and the right hon .Gentleman ( Mr.Shore ) be surely right when he say that the line of demarcation between regulation and directive be far from clear or sharply mark — then the Commission or the Council of Ministers could penetrate directly , by - pass all parliamentary procedure , into the law of this country .

22214-1972-06-06.16.1.17.4-labour	we be not sufficiently mindful of the great mass of people we employ , sometimes needlessly in my opinion , do work that other people be be pay to do .the delivery of letter or notification to tenant of a possible rent increase be not the duty of a highly - pay rent officer .I be glad that some regard be have to the ordinary taxpayer who at the end of the day will have to pay for a considerable number of rent officer .this be one of the great problem with new legislation ; it add to the bureaucracy that be almost overwhelming and swamp this country .this be a little step towards rectify that particular wrong .
18450-1972-06-08.12.2.138.3-conservative	I return to the point that this element of continuity in financing be essential if the Common Market be to become anything more than merely a free trade area with a cumbrous mechanism of bureaucracy plant on top of it .without some such element of continuity we shall not succeed in make the Common Market into anything more than a glorify free trade area .
18912-1972-06-13.15.1.37.1-labour	I intervene briefly to say that important point of principle be involve here .there be a fear that the executive and the bureaucracy of the EEC have tremendous power which will not easily be check by the member parliament of the EEC .for that reason there be a strong case for make sure that the European Assembly will have great power of check and balance than it have now .one of the advantage of go into the Community at this stage — although I be not in favour of the Bill as a whole — be that we shall be able to take part in the current discussion aim at strengthen the power of the parliamentarian vis - à - vis the EEC .

-1972-07-06.14.1.57.13-na	when the matter go to the Department of the Environment , I be not honour by a personal letter from the Secretary of State .I get a letter from the Under - Secretary .the Department be split into little pocket , and I make no complaint about that .but this be a serious matter .the Under - Secretary of State for the Environment , bring face to face with this problem — not directly through I but indirectly through the Department of Education and Science — be shunt it over the counter to another Department .he say : we do appreciate that there be a problem here , but because of the further issue which arise on this particular boundary , I really do think that on balance it would be much more satisfactory to leave this over for the Boundary Commission 's detailed review and to make arrangement meanwhile .the hon .Gentleman continue : but there will be no reason why the new school should not vest in the metropolitan district from the start , if be catchment area be so overwhelmingly in that district .thus it would be possible for the school to be the property of the metropolitan district , and be administer by they , from the outset , even though the actual boundary between the two county be not adjust until a little later .I hope that this consideration will allay the fear feel locally , and will enable you to withdraw your amendment .that be quite a courteous approach to I , but I do not accept it .why should I withdraw the Amendment and accept a pig in a poke from any Government Department ?as a Member of Parliament , I have live with Government Departments for 22 year , under government of both political complexion , and often I be extremely sceptical of they .on a matter such as this , they have a technique for always dodge a difficult column .it be nothing to do with party politic .it be to do with the nature of bureaucracy .
17426-1972-07-12.13.1.19.3-conservative	my misgiving be not altogether allay when my hon .friend , no doubt with the good of motive , say that to give particular would involve unnecessary cost .whenever one hear that as a reason give by the bureaucracy one 's hackle rise .

"""""""
22067-1972-07-25.12.3.37.7-labour	like the Government , the Bill be abrasive .the Government should not bring it in until they have consider the abrasive aspect of it .it will greatly anger , as it have already anger , many million of people .it will be particularly annoying since it will take power from local government , from the people , and pass it to the centre , to the bureaucracy .rent will be determine not by the housing chairman and his committee after they have be elect by those whom they represent .they will be determine by official , perhaps responsible and able man but official none the less who have no allegiance to the electorate in the area concern .perhaps more nastily , rent may be determine neither by able civil servant nor by elect local representative but by gentleman , who may well stand to benefit , sit on rent scrutiny board and draw a considerable income as a result .
10152-1972-08-02.20.1.2.20-labour	there be objection to put the whole Conservancy in the Department of the Environment .that would have be my first choice , but the ipcs have serious objection and the ipcs be to fight , that in itself be a reason for not do it .I gather from the professional organisation that it do not want this .the matter of over - ride importance be to keep the Nature Conservancy together , not to have Monks Wood or other part hive off .to put it in the word of John Tinker in an article in New Scientist , what we do not want be a rump of a Nature Conservancy which have become a second - rate bureaucracy staff by land agent .these be high - quality people we be talk about .
18728-1972-08-03.15.1.11.8-labour	in this modern world , there be great talk of devolution , of more responsibility be place on individual .this be a very important political matter .it be a wide matter which we could discuss at great length .I shall not pursue it too far .however , if we be to have partnership with industry and if we be to enable our ordinary citizen to feel that they be part of government , we must create a body of the kind we propose .there be a great danger that Britain will be subject to decision of a bureaucracy without adequate parliamentary scrutiny or check .it be reasonable that in the Bill some machinery should be create which would enable the House of Commons and industry connect with agriculture and food to have their say and convey their view adequately to our Minister , who , after all , will be on the Council of Ministers and here , too , will be responsible for the new policy which will emerge in Europe .
18728-1972-08-03.15.1.11.15-labour	that mean a great deal of work for the Department and various other people who will have to be find to man the committee , which I assume will sit in Brussels and will be in touch with the Commission and the bureaucracy there .they will no doubt report to the Council of Ministers , whose view will perhaps filter down through our british representative on the committee to the Minister here .would not it be far well if we create the sort of committee spell out in detail in our Amendment and the Clause ?
18728-1972-08-03.15.1.11.24-labour	that be why we have move the Clause .we have seek to create a new type of machinery which would enable we to have a discussion through the representative of the agriculture producer , worker in the agriculture trade and the food industry , worker in agriculture and the food industry and the consumer .they could all have their view make known to an advisory committee , which in turn advise the Minister .I do not think that this would mean a vast bureaucracy or that it would cost much .we have spell out the number , say that each group should have three representative .the cost would be a small price to pay for co - operation , and I believe that it would be sensible to pay it .the Minister have claim that he be cut down administrative cost .one of his justification for the Bill be the argument that he have to make cut in service .
16421-1972-08-03.15.3.10.7-labour	we believe that when it deal with large sum of money and affect the life of the people then we have the right to have a say .perhaps hon .and right hon .gentleman opposite do not accept this , but this be what we be try to achieve .they should not bring forward this kind of argument and ask a junior Minister to present it .the Government say that the advisory board we propose be too wide and would have insufficient knowledge .have the right hon .Gentleman never hear of a staff of expert to advise an advisory board ?why not draw upon that ?be it because he be put so many civil servant into the intervention Board that there will be none leave ?someone ask early about the number involve in the board .we have be tell that there will be 200 in the board headquarters at read alone .this be another bureaucracy .they should not come forward to we with nonsense about inflexibility and bureaucracy because it be they who be introduce this — a government who be elect to cut back the Civil Service .

18728-1972-08-03.27.1.7.9-labour	the EEC Bill will affect this Bill .I deal with that matter when we discuss the county committee and the need to have adequate advisory service whereby Ministers would be able to know what be happen in the industry .it be important that the consumer and those in the industry who contribute to the work and development of the industry should have their view know by the Minister and those who make decision .even though it be not in the Bill , and I appreciate I will be out of order if I develop it too far , inevitably loom over these matter be our entry into Europe .our decision could be take out of the hand of the House by the bureaucracy in Brussels .if I feel worried about that as a parliamentarian it be because I desire to protect british parliamentary tradition and , above all , to make sure that british farming be not harm by people outside this country .

18267-1972-08-08.11.1.24.1-conservative	I remind my hon .friend that small firm which be cover by a training board will be able to get advice and help from the training board , and that exempt small firm will be eligible for selective grant bear by the Exchequer and not by the training board if they qualify for they .we intend to maintain the help for small firm , and the proposal seek to remove the element of bureaucracy and administrative complication .
22082-1972-10-19.11.1.136.2-labour	before he depart to go on television tonight , my hon .friend the Member for Bassetlaw ( Mr. Ashton ) make great play of the argument that the presence of television camera would gravely alter our proceeding .but there be selection already , selection as between one Member and another , gravely damage for some of we , which go on because of what Aneurin Bevan call the ipse dixit of the television bureaucracy — choose the hon .member for Chelmsford ( Mr. St. John - Stevas ) or my hon .friend the Member for Bassetlaw to go on television instead of other hon .member who have make worthwhile contribution in the debate today .
18806-1972-10-19.13.1.17.19-ulster_unionist_party	the order clearly show that the re - organisation of local government in Northern Ireland be proceed with in such haste by the former Administration that insufficient attention be give to its full financial implication .even at the back of the order there be nine page of repeal of exist Statutes .the order be a further example of bureaucracy in Wonderland .no mention be make of the method of calculation of the regional rate .the Ministry be oblige neither to explain , nor to justify the rate fix .it be virtually a licence to print money .
17097-1972-10-31.7.1.71.1-conservative	I be sure that those on the Government Front Bench be aware that we be go into Europe .but my hon .friend have point to something very important that I wonder about .I be not sure about the civil servant or the bureaucracy behind the Ministers .the Government must begin to think about what be say in the House and by the people in the country who be represent through this House ; they should not merely listen to technical advice give to they in the Ministry , which be often base on a bureaucratic view that might have be correct many year ago .this apply to road development , and to the M2 , which stop 20 mile short of Dover .
22154-1972-11-03.4.1.30.22-labour	the present Secretary of State for the Home Department on 21st May , 1968 , go far and produce seven reason why a price and income policy be a nonsense .first , he say that one have to get Government expenditure under control .he have have two year to do that .secondly , he say that it be necessary to cut back the last three year ' over - growth of the bureaucracy .he have not cut it back but increase it rapidly .thirdly , he be go to give new and substantial incentive to save by introduce a contractual saving scheme , a save as you earn scheme .
22486-1972-11-09.12.1.4.6-conservative	this be not mean - minded bureaucracy .there be two practical reason base upon equity between one person and another .if it be not for this rule there would be little to prevent a person with a poor contribution record over the year but a good one in the year or so before pension age from get what would , in effect , be a full pension for five year from the age of 65 to 70 by the simple device of refrain from give notice of retirement and claim sickness benefit .my hon .friend go some way to concede that this would be unfair to people who have pay a full contribution over the whole of their work life .it would also be unfair to the man who be force to retire at 65 , possibly because of ill - health or because his job be no long available to he .
19355-1972-11-16.14.5.5.3-conservative	my hon .and learn Friend say that because this be a Bill for temporary measure it can be say that it have be hastily draft and have strong power than be strictly require .the principle that govern all legislation should be that the liberty of the subject must take precedence over the convenience of the bureaucracy .we should like to be assure that in the implementation of the Clause the Executive will not ask for any information which be not reasonably require under the Act .
16651-1972-11-16.14.5.6.2-conservative	the anxiety express by my hon .and learn Friend the Member for Dover , and re - echo by my hon .friend the Member for Dartford ( Mr. Trew ) , be fair and real .it be not that we have any lack of faith in the sensible way in which my right hon .and learn friend will proceed , although bureaucracy have an ability to self - perpetuation , even beyond the day - to - day control and supervision of a preside Minister .therefore , it be important that this Parliament be make its first essay in legislation to control income and price .
18046-1972-11-28.12.1.41.3-conservative	bad pension be bad whether they come from the private sector or the public sector and ultimately this Bill must be judge by the type and size of the pension it will produce .I believe that private pension scheme be more likely to be more efficiently manage than those of a State bureaucracy .by give people a pension base on real saving and which they actually own , one will be in the position to increase contribution and fund much more easily than one could have increase taxation under the Crossman scheme .under the Government 's type of scheme , the proceed can be invest in real asset which can keep pace with inflation .
16823-1972-11-29.4.1.17.1-conservative	will my hon .friend bear in mind that it might be of great value to the economy of Scotland to reduce the burden of bureaucracy overall than to increase the burden of bureaucracy in Scotland ?
22010-1972-11-29.4.1.18.1-conservative	I certainly agree that one of my responsibility be the burden of bureaucracy .there be a question on the Order Paper about this matter , and I have some quite encouraging figure to announce .
22218-1972-12-04.4.1.45.2-labour	we be make a change that will affect half the population of Scotland in respect of education .these be not strategic service .they be the sort of service which be suppose to be delineate for the region .education and social work be personal service .it be not good enough to make this change and for the Secretary of State to say that it be a matter for the new regional council .it may be that overall planning , which be the touchstone in respect of the large region and the estuarial concept of planning could have be achieve without the destruction of efficient local administration in these very personal service , but if we do not watch where we be go we shall get a blueprint for bureaucracy and local frustration .that be one of the great danger .
19552-1972-12-04.4.1.121.5-conservative	councillor , like Ministers and member of Parliament , have to deal with strongly entrenched , dedicated and intelligent bureaucracy .in some case they will be deal with man and woman far well pay than themselves , and there be therefore a psychological element .in my experience councillor be too prone to yield to the official , even in case of individual injustice , and the official be pay much more than the councillor to do the job .I fear that the effect of this reorganisation , with its large cut in the number of councillor , will strengthen the power of the official to an inordinate degree .I have nothing against official , but power must lie with the elect representative because it be they who have to answer for it if that power be abuse .
19152-1972-12-06.12.1.14.14-labour	the problem be great in primary school and even great in secondary school , because unless we provide a reasonable atmosphere , with reasonable flexibility in the timetable and a room for each teacher , we be immediately in trouble .I have have 13 year of that , and I be feed up with it .this be because the Whitehall bureaucracy do not understand teacher ' need .if a professional person such as a doctor say that in an operation room he need this , that or the other sort of equipment , it be provide straight away ; but that do not happen for teacher .these regulation be a case in point .
18980-1972-12-08.4.1.85.26-conservative	only at that point will it be possible to tell whether there be any subject require further treatment and what that treatment should be .maximum use should clearly be make of exist institution such as the Economic Commission for Europe which already have considerable experience of East - West economic relation .the regional organ of UNESCO might also be able to play a useful rôle in cultural matter .where there be no exist body then the conference will have to consider whether a new one should be establish .in our view any new body should be provide with specific term of reference and should be wind up when its task have be complete .I be sure that honourable member will agree that we must be very wary about create new international bureaucracy .there be enough in the world already .someone will have to pay for they .
16877-1972-12-14.10.1.21.7-labour	"""the Government have already subscribe to a monetary and an economic union .they have say that they have put their hand to the conclusion of such a union by 1980 .a monetary and economic union be the end of national sovereignty unless we be to have a vast bureaucracy , irresponsible and unaccountable to anyone .I do not think that there be any dispute about that on either side of the House .therefore it be logical for the Heads of Government meet together and for the pro - Europeans , have secure the objective of an economic and a monetary union , to drive on and to say , """" now we must have a political union .now we must strengthen the European Parliament so that it control the European Government""""—whatever form that may take ."""
19169-1972-12-14.10.1.103.23-conservative	in the debate on Friday , the Under - Secretary say that the question of continue machinery be difficult .he also say that we should be very wary of international bureaucracy and he say that we already have enough of those .he also ask who would pay if one be to be set up .although I respect his general attitude to this , I do not agree on this point .I think that the good result we could see from this conference would be the setting up of some sort of permanent organisation whose object would be to discuss , to research , to study and to co - ordinate the approach to our common european problem .
17403-1972-12-15.3.1.74.5-conservative	secondly , although we have speak about road , planning and housing , what we have not really ask my hon .friend to examine be the question of Greater London public transportation in its wide sense .over and over again we talk about motorway , but far too little be say about the possibility of an outer circle link line .one day the hon .member for Acton and I spend about an hour on Radio London talk the matter over .we be undivide on it , because we both believe that such a line be necessary .the bureaucracy in the official setup of British Rail and of the old London Passenger Transport Board — now London Transport — must be sweep aside .easy link could be re - open to give we an effective outer circle railway .
22502-1972-12-18.9.1.58.5-labour	I profoundly regret that the Government have not accept the Opposition proposal for set aside a date for debate Prayers .we have a right to debate Prayers .it be a fundamental safeguard of democracy against bureaucracy , and bureaucracy today be much more dangerous than autocracy .

16950-1973-01-30.10.9.6.1-ulster_unionist_party	I be aware of the right hon .Gentleman 's point and , of course , it be take into consideration .what lie say be true , but , equally , there be those small firm which probably should not be within the scope of these board and exempt .also , we have to take into account the amount of bureaucracy involve .what we be try to do be to achieve a balance between good training and remove some of the bureaucracy .
21743-1973-02-05.6.1.22.2-labour	the Bill fit into a familiar pattern .it follow last year 's Local Government Act .in that Act we see the break - up of our local government system .the Opposition think it be their duty at that time , week after week and month after month , to draw attention to the growth of regional bureaucracy .we highlight that matter when the Bill return to the Floor of the House .it be our case , certainly in the sphere of local government , that the real and vital decision will be take increasingly by the regional arm of Ministries and not by elect local authority .
21695-1973-02-05.6.1.75.2-conservative	the hon .and learn Gentleman , like the hon .member for Birmingham , small Heath ( Mr. Denis Howell ) , express his concern about the regional authority and their size in particular , and the hon .member for Small Heath express his concern about the great regional bureaucracy , although later he say that it be the Labour Party 's policy — not that the Labour Party will ever have the chance — to establish regional water authority .there seem to be some contradiction in what he say .
18935-1973-02-06.11.1.27.14-conservative	the Opposition have not say how they will do it , how the plot will be identify , and they have not give any estimate of the bureaucracy require , but we have some experience of their past performance .they can hardly derive encouragement from the record of the Land Commission , which in three year acquire just over 3,000 acre and dispose of just under 300 acre .
18562-1973-02-07.6.2.3.1-conservative	on a point of order , Mr. Speaker .some week ago I complain about the impossible position in which we be place when question the Minister for the bureaucracy and as a result of your sympathy his position on the Order Paper be advance from Question no .40 to Question no .30 as the commencing point .the situation today have demonstrate that start at Question no .30 be no good either , and we be —

19212-1973-02-21.11.1.39.6-labour	secondly , such concession lead to administrative cost and a certain amount of bureaucracy .
18267-1973-02-28.9.3.52.2-conservative	[ laughter . ]I be not quite sure which way round to put it .I would tell he that there be not go to be any vast bureaucracy .we have already say that the number of people on the agency will be some 700 .the point be that these be agency and their object be to act .
18267-1973-02-28.9.3.58.5-conservative	my hon .friend the Member for South Angus go too far in call three year a life sentence for the market economy and in say that it involve an irreversible degree of market distortion .as the hon .member for Ashton - under - Lyne say , before set up our system we consult the United States and other country and take into account the lesson they have learn .those country also take into account the lesson they have learn from other country and the lesson of the Second World War and the Korean War .the decision to concentrate on the major company be design to lessen the degree of bureaucracy , and there be no question that the adoption of this feature of the United States system will allow future government to command the height of Socialism .

16421-1973-03-01.13.1.4.12-labour	there be a description of the method by which our farmer will have to embark on a process which I be sure will be incredibly distasteful to they .we be tell that not less than 40 metric ton of cereal must be denature in one day .and in term of fishmeal , not less than 50 metric ton in 30 day , or 20 metric ton in a work day of 8 hour this be 1984 bureaucracy .it be the kind of detail for which the authority be now ask .
16421-1973-03-01.13.1.4.14-labour	the next matter I want to consider be the extension of the bureaucracy .I should like to refer to part 15 of our 42 - part set of regulation — among the thousand of regulation which we must now obey .I look at the kind of form which our farmer be to be ask to complete .there be a section on mule , and there be page of instruction to be read before return can be make .I refuse to believe that this kind of bureaucratic monstrosity should apply to the kind of form which farmer have become accustomed to complete in the past .the document in question extend to page 63 before we come to the end of the instruction which be say to guide farmer .come friendly form and fall on the Ministry of Agriculture !
16394-1973-03-01.13.1.37.8-ulster_popular_unionist	I await with great eagerness the reply of the Minister , but I look upon these innovation with regret and disdain .I be bear on a farm and so my sympathy have always go out to the farmer .I suppose I be therefore biased in favour of the farmer , a bias I do not regret .I feel particularly sad tonight about the future indicate by these measure .we have here the manifestation of a monster European Economic Community bureaucracy .
19169-1973-03-02.4.1.21.7-conservative	we all appreciate the need for that procedure , but those concerned resent the length of time involve and the general bother to which they be put .one hear — and I do not know how true this be — of many case in which the strict provision of the Act be not carry out for that reason .if we accept that people feel a slight resentment about the provision of the Merchant Shipping Act , even though we agree that there must be such provision , we must also recognise that under this measure there be to be impose what might be call another layer of bureaucracy on top of the layer that already exist .
18267-1973-03-05.6.1.143.4-conservative	the hon .member for West Lothian ( Mr. Dalyell ) ask about the number require in the agency in this context .this be the point .it will not require a large and cumbersome bureaucracy , simply because of the intention to keep control largely through the market leader , as my right hon .and learn Friend point out .the House will be able to judge by the quarterly report which both agency will have to put before the House .
21900-1973-03-12.14.1.87.11-conservative	these be fine phrase unless we have — the most fundamental factor of all — resource mobility , which we have not get in this country .every political and social mechanism be reinforce by one of the world 's most powerful and entrenched bureaucracy , exist at State , county , and local level .the bureaucracy resist the force encourage mobility by the most sophisticated and powerful mean .the proposal to confer mobility and increase it be consider as anti - social .in some case , they be completely neutralise and be often very severely restrict .on the other side of the counter - inflation balance sheet , we find ingrowe prejudice , professional buck - pass and institutionalised self - interest of every conceivable type of pressure group , all immensely skilled in prevent thing from be do .
16950-1973-03-13.8.1.71.24-ulster_unionist_party	we listen to those whom we consult and decide that the balance lie with continue the levy as a pressure for good training .equally , as my right hon .friend say , we think it right to modify the system to make it simple for everybody , to make it relevant to individual firm and operative in a way which eliminate bureaucracy , form - filling and time - wasting and , in particular , the burden upon firm which have be consistently concerned to carry out good training accord to their need , and there have be many of these .

18853-1975-10-13.32.1.8.9-conservative	the third question be whether we need the Bill at all to secure well planning .this question have still not be answer .it be still not show why all the apparatus , the bureaucracy , the expense , the compulsory acquisition , be necessary for good planning .I remain entirely unconvinced of the desirability of bring development land into public ownership .this be to be one of the consideration of the Bill , but it have never be effectively argue that it be need .however much the Government may have modify their stance on plan in response to pressure in Committee from my hon .friend and outside , the basic objection in principle remain .in particular , the duty to acquire from the second appoint day be as unnecessary as it be repugnant , with even the modify duty to acquire remain fraught with danger .
18853-1975-10-14.35.1.11.27-conservative	I turn now to the charge that , in essence , this Bill be a thoroughly bureaucratic monster .we have gain from the removal of the small category from the scheme , and we acknowledge that , but the Bill will still need — the Government never attempt to deny this — a massive increase in staff and bureaucracy .there be still doubt about the ability of the local authority to operate as developer .some of they may be able to do it .I do not deny that some of they have experience .however , to impose on every local authority the special skill will be very difficult .
16393-1975-10-14.35.1.47.4-conservative	planning decision on development be be take out of the hand and mind of those who will be affect by they and put into the hand and mind of those who will not be affect by they .I be immensely unimpressed .one of the danger in this country since the war have be that when there be a problem , it be hand over to the bureaucracy or an extension of the bureaucracy — carcinoma bureaucratica .decision be take by people who will not be affect by the result of take they .
10399-1975-10-14.35.1.49.3-labour	my right hon .friend be to be congratulate .we be tell that the Bill be a Communist Bill , that it represent the dead hand of bureaucracy on the neck of the british people , that it be the bad possible socialist measure we could have .yet it have now reach its Third Reading and the guillotine have not be use .the saga of the poor Industry Bill must pale into insignificance beside this measure .despite the trumpeting of the Opposition that they would fight the Bill line by line , from Second Reading , through Committee and Report , we have reach Third Reading without the guillotine .
22119-1975-10-14.35.1.57.8-conservative	socialist seem to think that the only way to solve problem be by pass legislation .then we get another long and involve Bill .this one will have the usual result — less land available , few house build , more muddle , bureaucracy , with the poor citizen leave muddle , bemused and sicken .this Bill be another in the long saga of interference with human right and the need for decent housing .
19004-1975-10-14.35.1.59.11-conservative	the fundamental criticism of the Bill be not the bureaucracy , not the cost , not the infringement of human right ; it be something that go back , as few people suspect , to our old friend Karl Marx and his theory that control of the land be control of the people .I be sure that some Labour member know the text from Das Kapital well than i.

"""" ]my immediate answer , as right hon .and hon .gentleman on the Government Front Bench know because they have hear it time and again , be that this can be deal with very simply through the taxation system without all this paraphernalia of bureaucracy and public ownership about which we be talk ."""
17403-1975-10-15.4.15.11.1-conservative	I thank the Minister for his helpful reply .will he develop it one stage far and accept the complaint which many of we receive from our constituent about the stupid bureaucracy in which local authority , irrespective of their political control , seem to indulge when tenant wish to transfer within the authority ' area ?will the hon .gentleman consider meet some of we to discuss this point ?
16651-1975-10-16.8.1.32.12-conservative	I wish my hon .friend the Member for Gloucester well and advise she to take a crash course in incineration because soon or later there will have to be evidence a political will to sweep away this policy and the bureaucracy that go with it .
21749-1975-10-20.8.1.10.1-labour	will the Prime Minister confirm that one of the factor which the Commission will be able to take into account be the appalling increase in bureaucracy since the reorganisation of the health service ?will he also accept that , since the health service be organise quite separately and differently in Scotland , there should be a separate part of the Commission 's report concern the recommendation for Scotland ?
21924-1975-10-20.8.1.11.2-labour	in my opening statement I make it clear that the National Health Service have go through a very unsettling phase .the hon .Member refer to the bureaucracy as a result of these technocratic provision in the legislation of 1973 , which have cause great unsettlement and — some people think — very great addition to the cost of the service .whether that be true be a matter for the Royal Commission to say , but certainly the whole organisation of the Commission 's work , so far as the Government be concern , and the establishment of it , will enable it to take full account of the difference between the legislation in Scotland and that south of the border , and to take full account of difference in the practice of the National Health Service in different part of Britain .
21823-1975-10-21.12.13.5.4-scottish_national_party	this be not a matter of increase bureaucracy ; it be the exact opposite .if there be a small but highly directional group of office in about half a dozen major centre in Scotland , few people would need to be employ at head office .the existence of local office will imply a small travel budget than if executive be base at Edinburgh or Glasgow .moreover , there will be a less top heavy bureaucracy at headquarters .
17605-1975-10-21.12.13.7.1-liberal	the Bill will inevitably greatly increase the already serious top heavy bureaucracy in Scotland , but there be no way out of that .that be a serious argument against the Bill .
17605-1975-10-21.12.13.7.2-liberal	the hon .Member for Perth and East Perthshire ( Mr. Crawford ) be optimistic in think that if the Agency have local office this will necessarily lead to less bureaucracy .I hope that it will , but there be the danger that we shall have an enormous central office and big local office as well .if I be certain that that would not happen — I be very far from be anything like certain — I should support the plea that it should operate , as far as possible , on a decentralised basis .
17605-1975-10-21.12.13.7.4-liberal	I be seriously concerned about the number of people and the amount of resource give to the bureaucracy — resource spend on energy ; indeed , resource of every sort — which be unproductively employ .that be a major factor in our economic distress , inflation and unemployment .
18236-1975-10-21.12.13.8.1-scottish_national_party	I agree with the right hon .Member for Orkney and Shetland ( Mr. Grimond ) on the question of bureaucracy , and whether , in relation to new clause 6 , by create local office the amount of bureaucracy involve be multiply .I think not , because the new clause would give autonomy to local office .rather than have a large monolithic body base in Edinburgh , with one overlord make all the decision , under our suggested framework there would be people in different area of Scotland with authority to take decision .
16403-1975-10-21.12.13.18.5-labour	the second part of the new clause provide for fix annual level of spending autonomy , and this again be a matter to be decide by the Agency .whatever happen , it be unlikely that local office will be able to go on their way without reference to headquarters .as the right hon .Member for Orkney and Shetland ( Mr. Grimond ) rightly say , if one spread activity too thinly one can create bureaucracy and delay decision - making rather than improve it .one thing bad than have no one on the spot be have someone on the spot who have no authority and have to keep refer back to headquarters .
16428-1975-10-21.14.25.7.6-conservative	the second matter by which we shall judge the Agency be the way in which it carry out its task , whether it be well or bad than the body now responsible .I refer specifically to the issue of derelict land and the improvement of the environment in Scotland , job that be now the charge of the local authority in Scotland .if it can do its job no well than exist local authority we shall be entitle to ask in future year whether the setting up of the Agency and the accompany bureaucracy be justify .I hope that it will lead to an improvement and to quicker and more effective action .if it be merely set up as duplication to what be already be do by local authority , the vision some people have of the work of the Agency will have be fulfil .to justify its creation it must carry out its task more effectively than the local authority .
22565-1975-10-22.4.1.5.1-conservative	as well as the concern about financial matter to which the hon .Gentleman refer , there be also concern about the apparent growth in the size of the bureaucracy .will the Secretary of State say to what extent the number of local official be now large than it be before reorganisation ?
10532-1975-10-22.12.1.91.1-labour	"""if the hon .Member study even the mild provision of the Bill and the industrial strategy which be reasonably propose by the Labour Party conference in """" Labour and industry : the Next Steps """" , he would find some genuine hope for this country .it be time the Conservatives grow up and stop prattle about the giant State bureaucracy of Russia and East Germany , because no Labour Member have any interest in the antic of those country ."""
16393-1975-10-22.12.1.96.2-conservative	there be two system .there be the system in which the decision be in the hand of those who be affect by they .there be also the bureaucratic system .hon .member may say that they be not interested in soviet bureaucracy , but bureaucracy do not differ .
19420-1975-10-22.12.1.180.2-liberal	since we be deal with a propose State corporation , the Government must tell we whether they recognise that the bad enemy of democracy , particularly in industry , be bureaucracy , that the good way to kill off this infant concept of industrial democracy would be to enshrine it in a labyrinth of meeting so tedious that only those who dare not face their wife would stay and where the chance of action or decision before 11 o'clock at night be so remote that only those with no other home would stay until resolution be take .we need some assurance that this concept will not be smother in bureaucracy from the very start .
10327-1975-10-22.12.1.216.2-labour	the hon .Member for Colne Valley ( Mr. Wainwright ) ask a question which I can not answer in the way he would like .I can not answer it , because he rightly say that industrial democracy should not be smother in bureaucracy as it advance .I agree that that would be fatal .if we be to lay down a precise blueprint which we be seek to impose , that would , from the beginning , establish a bureaucratic structure which would be alien to an evolve democracy .the remark by the hon .member for Caernarvon ( Mr. Wigley ) be particularly germane here .he liken industrial democracy to political democracy .political democracy in this country have be achieve over century of evolution .it be not something for which Simon de Montfort lay down a blueprint , to which we have be work ever since .we have be work towards political democracy through armed and political struggle , through struggle in the street and through struggle in Parliament .
10327-1975-10-22.16.1.5.3-labour	such company , and especially company of the size of British Leyland , not infrequently make acquisition and disposal in the normal course of business .the bureaucracy involve in obtain the Secretary of State 's permission for all these acquisition would cause needless delay and cost , and blunt the entrepreneurial outlook which the Government hope that the Board will be able to generate .it be for this reason that the Government introduce the power to give general authority to cover particular category of acquisition and avoid the need for each acquisition to be vet individually .
10327-1975-10-22.16.1.5.7-labour	we should want to avoid such bureaucracy by the general consent arrangement .the fact be that , unless we build an elaborate legislative edifice , it be impossible to cover every eventuality .
10327-1975-10-22.16.1.5.8-labour	it be against this background that I ask the House to consider these amendment .I hope that I have make clear the many way in which the power of the Secretary of State to issue a general authority may be use to avoid bureaucracy and unnecessary limitation of the freedom of the NEB and its subsidiary to behave commercially .I have also make clear that even without a power to grant general authority the Secretary of State be give unfettered discretion by this clause .

17691-1975-10-27.6.1.77.10-conservative	meantime — here be a point of rare agreement with the Secretary of State — bureaucracy have establish itself to an overwhelming degree .I entirely accept that neither political party can excuse itself from this fact .it be absorb skill and time which would be far well use , as it be intend , in patient care .
17691-1975-10-27.6.1.77.11-conservative	number will be give and can be give , certainly in nursing term , of the effect of part of this bureaucracy .I know of instance where 30 nurse be now require full time on administrative work where previously 10 be use .I know of more than one case where 10 be now require instead of three .cumulatively this be tragic for the National Health Service .it be tragic and it be also expensive .
10565-1975-10-28.11.111.26.5-conservative	the Minister may say that the parent can serve a counter - notice on the local authority , as provide in the clause , within one month after the passing of the resolution , but he must know that deprived parent be often depressed and downtrodden and do not have the life force or will to appeal against the bureaucracy which have take away the child .they feel that the full weight of bureaucracy be bear down and crush they .
10565-1975-10-28.11.111.26.9-conservative	in this way , it would provide some continuity in the child 's life .without it , the child could pass from the natural parent into the bureaucracy of a local authority with social worker change year in and year out .the amendment would at least offer some continuity with the child from a person who have have close dealing with it for three year .this be a relatively modest amendment but it could make a lot of difference to the life of the child in the year to come .
18469-1975-10-30.10.10.3.7-conservative	on examine the Bill we find in clause 17 that the Board may recover from its levy any expenditure incur by it by way of administration .it would seem that levy will have to be raise immediately to finance the Board 's bureaucracy .alternatively , I suppose it could use its loan power to raise the money .as I understand it , those power exist only in anticipation of the levy that will subsequently have to be raise .
19303-1975-11-04.13.1.27.2-liberal	there be an enormous amount that the Government can and must do to rid the self - employ and other of bureaucracy .simplification of the tax structure be one matter for their attention , and the multi - rate vat a particular aspect of it .the rate position will depend on the Lay - field Report .
19303-1975-11-04.13.1.29.2-liberal	what be much more important than a specific tax , a specific amount of bureaucracy , or a particular planning decision for the self - employ be the climate in which they be require to operate .the plan of successive government have militate against the small trader and the small business man , and that be damage this country economically and be endanger its social fabric .
10628-1975-11-04.13.1.59.4-scottish_national_party	rightly or wrongly , the small trader and shop keeper and the self - employ person believe that they be fight for their economic life .they feel overburden by red tape , bureaucracy and the immense amount of paper work that have be throw on to they .VAT be a good example .VAT be a daft enough tax anyway , but when multi - rate tax be introduce it almost reach the level of an obscenity .for example , the small trader face a choice between nine different vat system in his daily operation .he now face a bundle of solid type vat regulation which be 2½ inch thick , which he must obey , otherwise he will bear the full stricture of the law .
10591-1975-11-04.13.1.75.21-conservative	I believe that the Government have wholly under - estimate the seriousness of the problem face the self - employ and the difficulty of small business .there be 2 million people self - employ in this country who work hard for the economy and make a great contribution .we have 1,250,000 small business employ 6 million people , and it can not be deny that the Government have do a great deal of damage to the self - employ and to small business .they have impose penal taxation , which have knock the heart out of business man and destroy enterprise .the Government have impose an enormous bureaucracy , a multi - rate vat , and capital transfer tax .
17822-1975-11-06.9.1.61.4-labour	I see that there be provision for an increase of 332 person in the bureaucracy that run the whole arrangement .I do not know what proportion that be of the exist bureaucracy , but it seem a substantial jump .how far do the Government exercise some effective surveillance over this crowd of people run the complicated bureaucratic system ?
16651-1975-11-06.9.1.65.12-conservative	in that sense , my message to the Chief Secretary be to take with he , when he go to the Council of Ministers , the spirit of Gladstone , if not his hobnailed boot , and to say to his european partner that he feel that co - operation can well proceed by Ministers meet together unclutter with grow european bureaucracy and grow european ambition of public spending .
21726-1975-11-06.9.1.69.17-conservative	hon .member have say that the bureaucracy be grow .they be right to point to that fact .I should have be stagger if its number have not grow .however , the number involve in item such as 32 more interpreter be peanut compare with the gigantic bureaucracy with which we have land ourselves in Whitehall partly as a result — other hon .member would say partly as a result of the failure — of traditional method of control and restraint which have be practise in this country .to compare the two be to compare like with unlike since we be refer to 1,000 versus 40,000 .there be no comparison .
17685-1975-11-07.4.1.5.7-labour	money from the EDF be distinctly slow in disbursement than be our own aid programme .therefore , the commitment of fund to the EDF could lead to under - spending or not use our own aid programme to maximum benefit .Considerable Commission bureaucracy be involve the intention of the Commissioners concerned with the fund be good , but they come up against all the Ministers and all the government and this lead to a slowing down .those two item will need to be carefully watch .we should not be uncritical in our approach to the implementation of the Lomé Convention .
21924-1975-11-11.5.1.8.1-labour	the hon .and learn Gentleman be right .indeed , when answer question about the Royal Commission , I indicate that I agree with the view that he express .consider the increase in public expenditure , bureaucracy , and the public sector borrowing requirement , it be clear that a high responsibility rest on right hon .lady and Gentlemen opposite in respect of the so - call reorganisation of health , water and local government .
18853-1975-11-11.15.5.12.6-conservative	subsection 5 ( b ) , if it be not amend , will be part of the wholly fearsome apparatus bring into be by the Bill , and I wish to make clear our attitude to this entire apparatus .we be absolutely pledge to repeal the Bill .I shall not go into that at length now , but the reason be manifold .first , it confer on local authority and joint board , or whatever other body the Government choose to employ , power and duty which , first , be wholly irrelevant and unnecessary for good planning .second , they be unnecessary for the recoupment of development gain .third , they be odious in their attack on the liberty of the individual , on his right to own property and on his protection against the power of public body .this be especially obvious when one see the excessive use of delegate legislation here propose .fourth , the Bill be calculate to promote both bureaucracy and public expenditure .at the end of it all , therefore , the Bill be purely and simply a socialist measure about land ownership , and the clause now before we be a good illustration of that .

16393-1975-11-11.15.25.135.1-conservative	we seem to have lose sight of the proposition that people serve other for the sake of do so and not to make a profit out of it .the Minister speak of philosophy .the Government 's philosophy be not that the land should belong to the people but that it should be take from they and put into the hand of the bureaucracy .it be an anonymous bureaucracy act against defenceless people .it be scandalous that in this neuter form it should be allow to ride over they and that they should not have the protection of representation and advice .that be the proposition put forward by the Government .
16393-1975-11-11.15.27.90.1-conservative	can the right hon .Gentleman explain two thing ?first , if he want to introduce a piece of tyrannical bureaucracy call land acquisition and management scheme , why do he not use the filthy word and stop corrupt the language by say LAMS ?secondly , before the Bill — which , God help we , I pray will never be pass — by what right have he be encourage local authority to indulge in scheme that may never come into be ?it be quite wrong that he should suggest that they should have be do so at this time .
16393-1975-11-11.15.33.18.1-conservative	that be where you make your mistake .it belong to million of people .it belong to anyone who own a farm , a field or a garage .you want to take it away from each and every one of they and put it in the hand of bureaucracy .you hate the people , det they —
19004-1975-11-11.15.41.11.3-conservative	I do not want to go into the hideous cost of the administrative bureaucracy that will be create for a disposal notification area .
19004-1975-11-11.15.41.13.3-conservative	we shall have delay , cost and bureaucracy , and , most of all , we shall have a serious risk that a number of people own home in a disposal notification area will find when they try to sell their property that the local authority will delay ; and so the deal will fall through and there will be a ripple effect and a whole series of deal will fall through , and a lot of people will be upset .People should be give the opportunity to express their view on the matter indirectly , and they should be make more aware of the circumstance in which they be likely to find themselves , so that it do not come as an unpleasant shock at the last moment , when people have think that they have set the sale of their house under way , to find out , probably from their legal adviser , that the local authority can not proceed and that there be no way in which to help .
10011-1975-11-12.19.1.2.7-labour	many Welsh people fear that this be a staging post on the way to total separatism .they fear that they can not meet the groundswell against bureaucracy by the creation of yet another layer of bureaucracy , particularly when the experience of local government be prove so disquieting in Wales .
21924-1975-11-19.6.1.49.14-labour	my one criticism — and not of the party opposite in what I be about to say — be that in recent year in particular there have be in some area of local government a big increase in the ratio between chief and Indians — or , perhaps well , between tooth and tail — between those engage in administration and those at the sharp end provide help for those in need , and so on .this ratio , the administrative overload , in the word of a famous Resolution of this House of 1780 , have increase , be increase , and ought to be diminish .but the big single factor in this wide area of our national life , extend from local government to water supply and the Health Service — I say this to anyone who talk about the increase in public expenditure — be in the drastically misconceive policy which lead to the re - organisation carry through in local government — duplication , double banking , a vastly increase bureaucracy , super - chief take on to supervise exist chief , and divide responsibility .let those whose single prescription for handle our nation 's problem lie in vague proscription of public expenditure examine their own record , their own responsibility , their own conscience — on water , on the Health Service and on local government .
21851-1975-11-19.6.1.81.8-plaid_cymru	the Conservative of great stature , the right hon .member for Sidcup , seem to take a different view from that of the Conservative Party in Wales .he realise the evil of the great growth of bureaucracy , as he tell we on television the night before last , and the need , therefore , for devolve more power to the people .he use that phrase himself .the Government take this attitude , too .that be why they be intend — though far in the future than we have hope — to establish a nationally elect Assembly in Wales .
-1975-11-20.9.1.31.1-na	the right hon .member for Devon , North ( Mr. Thorpe ) have make a typically refreshing speech .I agree with what he say at the outset — that we have have a Niagara of Bills churn out from this place .I see no particular merit in the quantity of Bills recommend in the gracious Speech .they clog up the work of the House , they distract the attention of Ministers and hon .member from the serious question of the day , and they add to the bureaucracy not only of the administration , but of industry and commerce outside .industry and commerce find it very difficult to keep up with the mass of legislation that pour out of the two Houses of Parliament .
-1975-11-20.9.1.31.2-na	there be also a serious danger that the people will be overwhelm by the mass of bureaucracy that they now have to bear , and the Government be do nothing positive to reduce that bureaucracy .the Gracious Speech seem to show that it will increase rather than decrease .
-1975-11-20.9.1.31.3-na	the proposal for Scottish and Welsh Assemblies could easily add to the weight of bureaucracy , not reduce it .although the proposal for devolution might be attractive in theory to a minority , they be fraught with problem .I hope that we shall use the next year or two to examine they very carefully before we rush into proposal that would not be generally acceptable .
-1975-11-20.9.1.31.4-na	it be always an anomaly that Northern Ireland Members be able to deliberate upon and to determine the law apply in England while at the same time have their own assembly at Stormont .be scottish and Welsh Members , as well as have their own assembly , and perhaps even be elect to they , as parallel member at the same time to be able to make law for England ?that would be anomalous and no English Member of Parliament would stand for it .English Members would demand assembly for the region of England , and that would simply add to the bureaucracy of which I complain .
-1975-11-20.9.1.31.15-na	to propose final solution for this malaise be not appropriate or possible in today 's debate , but there be two issue to which we must pay attention .one be the awful growth of the bureaucracy in the past 10 or 15 year .in a speech this morning at Eastbourne , the Prime Minister apparently refer to the growth in employment in municipality — an increase of 1½ million employee , from 1 million 15 year ago to 2½ million today .instead of grasp the problem , the Prime Minister have propose yet another committee as a watchdog .that be not a solution to the problem .
-1975-11-20.9.1.37.2-na	the right hon .Gentleman be less than frank .he pinpoint many evil in the present situation .however , he do not acknowledge the Conservative Government 's contribution to the twin evil of bureaucracy and the erosion of the manufacturing base of british industry .both problem may have continue under this administration but they develop at an accelerate rate from 1970 to 1974 .
-1975-11-20.9.1.37.6-na	there be another reason why I want this parliamentary workshop to work more thoroughly but less rapidly .the excess of law - making bear a relationship to one of the nation 's major current problem .I refer to the growth of bureaucracy .I do not always hold this view , but clearly there be a serious problem of bureaucracy today .the Prime Minister acknowledge that in a speech elsewhere .
-1975-11-20.9.1.37.7-na	the missing £ 5,000 million on which Mr. Wyn Godley comment recently before a Select Committee of the House and the apparent loss of control by the Treasury over some sector of public expenditure reflect partly , though not entirely , the growth of bureaucracy in many of our national institution .neither of the major political party be guiltless in the matter .indeed Parliament must share some of the blame for what have occur .
-1975-11-20.9.1.37.8-na	for example , recently the Sunday Times say that there have be an increase of 100 per cent .in the bureaucracy of the National Health Service in the past 10 year compare with a growth in the medical personnel of 25 per cent .much , if not all , of this expansion can be attribute to the legislation of the previous Secretary of State , the right hon .member for Leeds , North - East ( Sir K. Joseph ) .I wonder whether in the period 1972 to 1973 we as Members of Parliament ask ourselves whether the measure we be pass would have these consequence in the year ahead .the fact of economic life will , I be afraid , force we to be much more austere in our approach to legislation .
-1975-11-20.9.1.39.1-na	I know that my hon .friend have great knowledge of the National Health Service .he be right .many people have reservation .nevertheless , perhaps member of Parliament do not fully appreciate the situation .individual member — I certainly speak for myself — be surprised at the ramification of the bureaucracy with which we be now deal .
-1975-11-20.9.1.39.2-na	there be , I submit , a limit to the amount of bureaucracy which our society can carry , and at the same time there be the danger of imbalance between those employ in industry and those in service .this be particularly so because worker in industry be far more expose to the economic blizzard than be those in service , private or public .I do not suggest that recent Government measure will not bite hard in some sector of public expenditure — indeed , I fear that they will , and there be , for example , great concern about education cut — but I believe it to be true nevertheless that the industrial worker and the business man have have a far hard time during these past two year in wrestling with inflation than have many people in the public sector .
20052-1975-11-20.9.1.69.2-conservative	I deplore the fact that in this Queen 's Speech there be no attempt to control the ever - pervade bureaucracy that be come up and up upon the back of our industrialist .the hon .member for New - castle - upon - Tyne , East make a certain play with the small corner shop , and he say that price be high .but the small private business man be bully and badger by bureaucrat of every sort .the movement that we have see in recent month among the self - employ and small business man , complain about vat or the collection of vat and about their national insurance contribution , and all the fear and anxiety that the self - employ have be voice , be nothing as compare with the way in which they be bully and badger by bureaucracy .
20052-1975-11-20.9.1.73.3-conservative	I believe that the scottish and Welsh nationalist who be so keen on devolution be in part simply feed up with the central bureaucracy of Westminster .I believe that they would be , if not satisfied , at least more content if we could reduce the central bureaucracy in all its form .the nationalist think that they have a special problem .they have no more of a problem than we have in Kent .we dislike central bureaucracy .we dislike Westminster every bit as much as the entire Scottish National Party do .incidentally , it be most noticeable the way the member of that party come in to listen to the sound of their own voice and disappear when they have make their great oration .they be not particularly anxious to hear what anyone else think .this arrogance come strangely from those who set themselves up as such great democrat .
18586-1975-11-20.9.1.79.11-conservative	there be also a proposal for price display .if one believe , as the Government obviously believe , that by paper the wall of grocer ' shop with price display one will secure the avid reading of the display by customer before they make their purchase , I suppose that that , too , be a good thing , but to the shopkeeper it may well appear to be further bureaucracy that be unlikely to achieve very much .
18673-1975-11-20.9.1.124.1-conservative	I ask the hon .gentleman to look at the present scale of the deficit and to remember that at that time the nationalise industry be not the main source of inflation in the country as they be today and nor be the level of inflation as serious as it now be .we all know the kind of statement contain in our postbag from constituent who claim the converse of cost - effectiveness in the nationalise industry .I do not blame those who run and work in the nationalise industry who may be wrongly accuse of wastefulness , extravagance and over manning , but in their interest I believe that such information should be seek and make public as soon as possible .I do not blame those people because the problem be in the nature of the beast — it lie in the stifling bureaucracy of the organisation and its structure , which cause these deficience .

10565-1975-12-04.23.1.2.23-conservative	if local authority be really concerned to see people take responsibility and pioneer new activity they would open their department to help and advise such group and help they to prepare application .this again , as the Minister will know , be a matter which I , when I be Director of the Young Voluntary Force , advance as a way of encourage volunteer group to submit application , because even now they do not know the machinery of local government or Government .unless there be a department in the local authority that can advise and help they to draft their application , some of the most creative work will go by the board , because those who be good on the creative side of the job be not good at submit application and deal with bureaucracy .
17522-1975-12-05.4.1.25.3-conservative	there will be an enormous amount of extra paper chase around the country as a result of the institution of this procedure .I can not believe that a less bureaucratic procedure be not possible .the Home Secretary make the fair point that there would be doubt about the full independence of police authority .however , I believe that it would have be preferable to build on police authority rather than to set up a wholly new independent board .after all , complaint against chief officer will still be hear by police authority , and it could be think that the police authority would be less independent when consider complaint against chief officer than they would be in the case of complaint against those officer who be low down the scale .therefore , the Home Secretary have go unnecessarily far in the direction of bureaucracy .surely the objective of any independent inquiry into the complaint procedure be that it should dovetail in with the exist proceure .this will not happen under the Bill .the introduction of an independent procedure will be introduce in opposition to the present procedure .
22503-1975-12-05.4.1.43.3-conservative	I accept the principle that there need to be an independent element in the judgment of complaint against the police , and I honour the Home Secretary for have fulfil his commitment to introduce such an independent element .have say that , however , I do not like the Bill .I do not like its content , I do not like its timing , and I believe that it be out of touch with opinion in the country .it will add materially to the paperwork and the bureaucracy that already make far too heavy demand on operational police manpower , and I be sure that it will add very much more substantially to public expenditure than the figure give .
19723-1975-12-05.4.1.90.7-labour	as to whether the legislation be necessary , on the information so far give by the Home Secretary it would appear that we be create a bureaucracy for nothing at all , if , indeed , the exist situation be satisfactory .I think that my right hon .friend say that there have be 31 conviction out of a total of 17,500 complaint .that seem a fantastic ratio .if that be so , we ought to be devise method different from those outline in the Bill .there be either something very seriously wrong with the exist procedure for complaint or the Bill be totally inadequate .no doubt much more will be say about that .

19156-1975-12-15.10.1.76.13-conservative	it be clear that both side of the House agree not to go along with the Prime Minister 's speech about Chiefs and Indians which he make at Eastbourne a week or two ago .if central Government be properly limit public expenditure and the local authority section be be limit , but imperfectly , the answer be not to have special watchdog committee , which I believe would be an extraordinary amalgam of elect councillor , ratepayer and officer .that would undoubtedly generate a new bureaucracy .the answer be to ensure that the councillor do the work properly and that central Government take their share of the responsibility by not add burden .
19212-1975-12-18.20.1.2.4-labour	one of the reason for this neglect be the municipal reorganisation which be push through some year ago .we now generally recognise that that reorganisation be too hasty , ill - conceived and do not achieve the economy which it set out to achieve .I have be fascinated to read the diary write by our late colleague Mr. Richard Crossman .he describe graphically the work which he do as a Minister during that important period .however , what he aim to achieve during that period have not be achieve .the reorganisation of local government have not result in a well local government service for the british people .it have result in a growth of bureaucracy .
19420-1975-12-18.21.1.8.3-liberal	my main purpose in speak on the eve of the preparation of the White Paper be to try to demolish three very silly fairy tale that vested interest and lazy mind have put about on the subject of english regional devolution .first , there be the absurd myth that there be no great desire for devolution in the region .this be a tempting argument for big business and the bureaucracy to believe , because they be outraged by the trouble cause by have to accommodate different feeling and different market response in different part of the country .many national newspaper be try to get out of the bother of print in Manchester as well as London by say that the people of England be now all alike and there be no long a need for a northern edition .this be the product of laziness and a narrow commercial view .it have no genuine base in fact .
19420-1975-12-18.21.1.8.9-liberal	the third fairy story — this be really assume dangerous proportion in the argument — be that , however desirable to the english region devolution may be and however great may be the demand for it , we shall have to suffer for a long time under the evil of the Local Government Act 1972 , and we must not add more tier of government .of course we must not add more tier of government .liberal would be the last people to suggest add to the appalling weight of bureaucracy , interference and control .
19420-1975-12-18.21.1.8.13-liberal	some people ask what there be to show for a measure of regional independence .I shall briefly point out some of the benefit which the scot have enjoy for year as a result of the relatively small measure of devolution which they have already get at St. Andrew 's House in Edinburgh .for year Aberdeen have have a gold rush of its own .even the bureaucracy could not stop the gold rush to Aberdeen because of North Sea oil .
21924-1976-01-13.5.1.16.2-labour	when the right hon .Gentleman , interpret paragraph 57 , try to lift the position of the Secretary of State above Parliament , he be totally wrong .the Secretary of State be answerable to Parliament .no court be answerable to Parliament .we find that in all the argument about industrial relation in the early 1970 .however , not only be my right hon .friend the Secretary of State for Scotland — and the Secretary of State for Wales and all other Secretaries of State — answerable to this Parliament ; I think I be right in say that , under paragraph 57 , his action would require an affirmative order by this imperial Parliament .that be the difference .that be the difference between a parliamentary democracy and a legalistic , judicial bureaucracy of the kind that the right hon .Gentleman have in mind .
21924-1976-01-13.5.1.28.17-labour	recently , at all level of local government , I find , and I be sure that honourable member in all part of the House find , the severe criticism of duplication , overlapping and bureaucracy , through this entirely unthought - out and , as it have now become clear , scatty proposal .I can not , therefore , accept the argument that we should repudiate the programme of devolution , endorse by the people in two General Elections , simply because we have inherit the recently create two - tier system of local government in the three country .
19284-1976-01-13.5.1.47.2-conservative	part of the dislike of increase power and the rôle of Government be the spread of the bureaucracy it have create , and the cost of pay for that bureaucracy .a true devolution should reduce both .
19284-1976-01-13.5.1.53.6-conservative	the second feature be the massive extension of bureaucracy and its cost .about 3,000 extra civil servant , on the Government 's own reckoning , and £ 22 million a year at present - day price would be require .within this figure would be 1,600 civil servant and £ 12 million for Wales .if that system be to be apply to England and Wales as a whole , I understand that the cost could be £ 150 million a year — not exactly an example of economy .so we be to have more complicated and more costly government and for those with devolve Assemblies , more government , but not necessarily well government .
22240-1976-01-13.5.1.135.7-conservative	then it seem to I , as my right hon .friend emphasise , that one of the reason for nationalism in Wales , Scotland and elsewhere be that we be suffer from over - government in every sector , a piling of bureaucracy upon bureaucracy .since the present Government take office , new commission have be create almost at a rate of knot — new bureaucracy , new committee , to deal with the many social problem with which we be undoubtedly face , but all of which take more and more choice from the individual and put the power of decision more and more in the Government .therefore , it be natural that in Edinburgh , Glasgow , Shetland , Orkney , Carmarthen and elsewhere , people should resent government — though they call it central government , it be government in its modern form — and one of the good way of combat this kind of devolutionary feeling be to relieve the country of some of the burden of over - government from which we be all suffer .
17607-1976-01-13.5.1.159.6-conservative	it be say that the Assembly will need an extra staff of 600 rise to 1,600 civil servant .experience of both national and local government bureaucracy have rather jaundice most people 's view of the accuracy of this estimate .bad than that , however , the Government believe that these man and woman should be full civil servant interchangeable with those in Whitehall .it seem madness to put such people under the strain of serve two master , especially when the Government at Westminster might be of a different political colour from that at Cardiff .
17607-1976-01-13.5.1.159.10-conservative	the Prime Minister hit the idea of the reform of local government on the head this afternoon , at any rate in part , as he do at Eastbourne in November .on that occasion he say : no one see a further major change in local government in the year immediately ahead .I repeat , local government have enough on its plate without add the prospect of another reorganisation .that mean that if we have an Assembly , we shall have , to face layer after layer of electoral body .we shall be elect community council , district council , county council , the Welsh Assembly , the Westminster Parliament and the European Parliament .on and on and on it will go , and I predict that people will soon get tired of it , question the expense and necessity of it , and feel that it be electoral bureaucracy go mad .it would be a clear case of excessive and over - expensive government and of an indecisive and querulous form of government .
19178-1976-01-13.5.1.165.4-conservative	we be already overgoverne because in recent year government of both party have try at time to do too much .the effect therefore have be only to produce a great bureaucracy .but the effect upon this Parliament , this institution of our in this House , could be catastrophic .it be bind to be a weakening of the power of this Assembly , the national Parliament , which be once itself the country 's big asset .
10011-1976-01-13.5.1.189.13-labour	I predict that there will be a considerable backlash in the principality if our people be lead unwillingly along a road they do not want to take and which they be be lead along because of suppose problem in Scotland .why be there this hostility in Wales ?the first factor be the local government reorganisation , and this reason be in itself twofold .the first be on the more popular level , where our people think that an Assembly would be a far costly and irrelevant bureaucracy .the second be on a more sophisticated level , illustrate by the cogent argument put by the Association of County Councils in a letter date 8th January and circulate to many hon .member .that argument , broadly , be , first , that our new county structure be just begin to settle down and to be recognise by the people of Wales , who be now begin to identify with it .by and large , it be now do a good job .
10572-1976-01-13.5.1.199.3-labour	"""Wales be a small nation of about 2·5 million people .it will be govern , under these proposal , by parish council , district council , county council , the Welsh Assembly , Westminster and Brussels .I wonder whether the Welsh people know what be in store for they .they will be gorge on government and smother in bureaucracy .as a Lancastrian I say """" God help they """" , because this House do not appear to be do so .I be as proud of my heritage as any Celt in this House be proud of his .I should like the unity of the United Kingdom to be maintain .I want our political party universally to tackle the problem which affect our constituency rather than pursue the spurious proposal in the White Paper ."""
10591-1976-01-13.5.1.205.16-conservative	I do not condemn the Government 's proposal out of hand .it be virtually impossible to draw up an Assembly White Paper without cost a great deal of money , without create more bureaucracy , without delay in decision - making , without frustration and without the possibility of lead to the break - up of Britain .no matter how it be approach , I suggest that we come to the same conclusion : although there be a case for more decentralisation and although we want more of our decision - make process for the United Kingdom as a whole spread throughout the country , if we have two parliament and two government in one island sharing power in this mysterious way we have a recipe for disaster .
17905-1976-01-14.7.1.86.2-labour	I want to put on record my basic view .to implement the present proposal as they stand would , I be convince , be a profound mistake .at a time when we should be simplify and rationalise government , with a view to make it more sensitive and responsive to the feeling of our people , we be add another layer of government with more bureaucracy and at additional cost when we should be shorten the chain between decision making , implementation and the citizen .
21695-1976-01-14.7.1.90.7-conservative	furthermore , region in England would merely create yet another bureaucracy with which the private citizen would have to battle and , incidentally , would detract from the power and discretion of local government , as , indeed , some of the statutory regional authority , such as health and water , have already do .it would be far more sensible to give local government more power and discretion rather than to reduce it .
22158-1976-01-14.7.1.124.6-labour	People be bemuse by it all — and , besides , they be have to pay heavily for it .I have always take a political position leave of centre and I find that some of my colleague on the Left be fail to recognise the evil of bureaucracy .our job be to try to ensure that public body do not become a haven for bureaucrat , because many of the people who sit on they have no identity with our view at all .in local government bureaucracy have just about reach saturation point .I be not blame our local representative for that because the structure be lay down by the last Tory Government .reorganisation be highly inflationary and have have an evil effect on the british economy .it have certainly not increase efficiency in local government .
22158-1976-01-14.7.1.124.9-labour	there be now a Welsh dimension to every matter affect Wales , and in this respect the Government 's proposal make sense .so I support they in a very broad context .but with the country 's economic difficulty , and the growth of bureaucracy or which we be all acutely aware , we have reach that stage where , in the Prime Minister 's word , there be too many Chiefs and not enough Indians .
22565-1976-01-14.7.1.129.8-conservative	again , because of their small number , scottish Members of Parliament have twice the opportunity of question Scottish Ministers that their colleague have to question English Ministers .we have hear much in the debate about the quality of government and the control of bureaucracy .I have serve in the United Kingdom Department for the Admiralty and in the largely English Ministry of Transport as well as at the Scottish Office , and I be convinced , as a result of that experience — which I do not believe have be share by any other hon .member of the present House — that there be a close scrutiny by member of Parliament and by Ministers of the work of the scottish governmental machine than that of any other Department because it be more intimate in size .an Assembly will not improve on that situation .
21902-1976-01-14.7.1.133.21-conservative	the ordinary man will be as critical as ever — as he have every right to be — of the new governmental set - up , and he will see at once that he be grossly over - govern , not only in the sense that he be subject to so many tier of government and their consequential bureaucracy but in the sense that politic will loom large in his life than he consider appropriate .politic will permeate his life .everything will be political , and he will not like it .
21989-1976-01-14.7.1.137.3-labour	there be some truth in that argument .those of we who point out that the Scottish Office be a large bureaucracy in Edinburgh deal with scottish housing , health , road and agriculture , over which we do not have adequate control , and who therefore argue the case for devolution , get a very frosty answer so long as there be no electoral steam behind the demand .when the steam come , then come the concession .

10446-1976-01-15.8.1.31.4-labour	on the day follow the publication of our White Paper , the Western Mail say in an editorial : More than a year ago we write in favour of a ministerial system in the Assembly and against the adoption of a committee system , argue a need for effective as well as more democratic government .local government committee be often ineffective and accountability be dilute by the diffusion of responsibility .however , the White Paper propose a judicious blend of both system , provide in practice for clear responsibility through the executive member and for the constructive involvement of all Assembly member , from whatever party , in policy formulation .I believe that rather than increase the force of bureaucracy we be strengthen the force of democracy in Wales .
10446-1976-01-15.8.1.52.2-labour	I turn now to the decision to keep a unified United Kingdom Civil Service .our belief that it would be essential to maintain the traditional independence of the recruitment system for Assembly civil servant at all time in the future give the lie to fanciful notion of a Welsh - speak elitist bureaucracy .the maintenance of a unified Civil Service mean that movement will be facilitated not only between the Assembly and the Welsh Office but between those body and other Government Departments — in Wales , in London , and in other part of the United Kingdom as well .this be part and parcel of the decentralisation which be now go on of major Government Departments to Cardiff , to Swansea and elsewhere in Wales .this process of cross - fertilisation will , I believe , be of the great benefit to the Assembly and to central Government .
21658-1976-01-15.8.1.101.3-labour	"""I shall not put forward my own opinion about the extension of bureaucracy because I believe that the bureaucrat should speak for themselves .I shall quote what a rather eminent bureaucrat in Wales say about these proposal : the White Paper state that the Assembly will need substantial number of staff and that number be difficult to estimate .broadly however the extra staff might be around 600 initially , rise thereafter to about 1,600 when the Assembly get into its stride .at the early level the extra run cost would be around £ 5 million , rise at the later stage to around £ 12 million .he go on to say : estimate of this sort be notoriously liable to be prove to be under - estimate and the Government 's argument that there will be administrative saving in Whitehall and the Welsh Office lack conviction """" .of course , I should not necessarily agree with that ."""
10386-1976-01-15.8.1.121.3-conservative	but this aspect be a frustration at over - bureaucracy , a frustration direct not against London but against government as a whole .
10386-1976-01-15.8.1.121.11-conservative	I want to come to the Government 's proposal .in look at any devolution proposal I would have four objective in mind .first , any devolution proposal should reduce the burden and overload on this House .clearly these proposal will reduce the burden on the House , but self - restraint by all government would do much more in that direction .secondly , I look to the proposal to deal with over - government and over - bureaucracy .I do not think that they will do anything about that .general political determination by government to deal with those problem be the right way in which to proceed .sadly , these proposal will greatly add to the danger of over - bureaucracy .as many have already point out , and as all experience of reform of our institution and structure have demonstrate , most reform lead to great and grander bureaucracy , to the despair of few and few doer .
14158-1976-01-15.8.1.135.1-labour	there be no question of imagination .my right hon .and learn friend say this in the Times .if he wish , I will send he a copy .he surely remember it since the article be grace with a delightful photograph of he .he explain how the Welsh Office have grow from have a mere 200 civil servant to about 1,500 , and , therefore , he be in difficulty about control his own bureaucracy .
14158-1976-01-15.8.1.137.2-labour	we shall not only have a huge bureaucracy , but it will be a special sort of bureaucracy .its huge Civil Service will have a special character .it will inevit- ably have at the top a Welsh - speak elite .it can not be otherwise .however many monoglot English - speak Welshmen be send to the Assembly , it will be bind to have bilingual proceeding .these would be demand immediately and , in view of the Welsh Language Act and the attitude of Plaid Cymru , could not be legitimately resist .
14158-1976-01-15.8.1.137.3-labour	it will not be just a question of the paraphernalia of immediate translation in the Assembly and bilingual documentation .the Welsh speaker , the fanatic , some of whom we have see in Plaid Cymru , would insist on speak Welsh not only in the Assembly but in their communication with the civil servant serve they .any non - welsh - speak top civil servant need to grasp with speed an issue or disputation which arise will find himself handicap and before long , as have happen in other devolve body such as the Welsh BBC , the gravy train will speed on with a top bureaucracy draw largely from less than one - fifth of the people in Wales .with an untried , inexperienced Assembly , a truncated local government system and member of Parliament render impotent , the real master of Wales will be a Welsh - speak bureaucratic elite .
10247-1976-01-15.8.1.143.3-labour	the Civil Service and the structure and administration of the bureaucracy have also grow .yet at the top of that massive increase , both in the power and the structure of the State and in the population for which the State be responsible , we have roughly the same number of democratically - elect representative to supervise this machine , who be ultimately responsible , politically and democratically , for its operation .at the turn of the century there be 670 member of Parliament compare with 635 now , but they also represent what be now the Republic of Ireland .
10247-1976-01-15.8.1.143.5-labour	it be almost fashionable nowadays to attack the Civil Service and bureaucracy .we should consider how we control the Civil Service by proper and reform democratic machinery instead of simply bemoan its undoubted power and size .our democratic structure on top of the administration have not change as it should have do this century .that be the crisis .that be why the title of the White Paper be not a bad one .
18931-1976-01-15.8.1.183.9-conservative	the danger also be that by have an Executive we shall create a mass of new bureaucracy .the White Paper point out that of the 1,000 new civil servant require in Scotland — itself a gross under - estimate — only 200 be necessary for the Assembly itself and the other 80 per cent .be require simply because of the new Executive .
10591-1976-01-19.6.2.6.2-conservative	in view of the grow doubt in the House of Commons and in Scotland whether the Government 's proposal on devolution will do any good at all , in comparison with the cost , bureaucracy and argument that they will introduce , will the Minister consider the possibility of hold a referendum on the question whether the people of Scotland want the rubbish present by the Government in their White Paper ?
17163-1976-01-19.8.1.17.3-labour	before come to that conclusion we consider various possibility for devolve taxation .none of they be attractive , and we could not ignore the administrative problem , problem as much for the taxpayer as for the tax collector .however , I do not wish to rest my case on administrative difficulty .if the argument for devolve tax power be sufficiently compelling , and if the additional bureaucracy be acceptable , the administrative difficulty would have to be overcome .I shall , therefore , attempt to deal with the various argument of those who object to the block grant and who advocate devolution of significant tax power .
18267-1976-01-19.8.1.82.12-conservative	let we take the first meaning that I give — devolution towards a form of decentralisation .there could be good , sensible proposal for regional government of one form or another which would — I agree with the hon .member for Roxburgh , Selkirk and Peebles ( Mr. Steel ) — include England .Scotland might have one or two region , Wales could be a region and Northern Ireland could be yet another .that would mean the United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster remain sovereign .incidentally , there would be no question but that we should deal with the Community in the same way as the Federal Republic of Germany do , rather than the Länder .that would require parity of treatment for the whole of the United Kingdom .that form of decentralisation , which be intend to remove the remoteness of Whitehall and to lessen the burden of bureaucracy , would require enormous change if we be not to build far on the bureaucracy in the structure of local government .those change would be subject to the sovereignty and choice of this Parliament at Westminster .
18267-1976-01-19.8.1.82.13-conservative	it be something of an illusion to think that the bureaucracy would be less burdensome because government be situate near to the people .I think that many people want not more involvement in government , but less government involvement with they .they want the Government to interfere less in the life of individual and to allow a great freedom of choice than we get at the moment with only 38 per cent .of the total national income at the disposal of the individual who have earn it .I think that we could form a series of coherent proposal with that sort of delegation .
17691-1976-01-19.8.1.108.5-conservative	so we have an add tier of government and the expense of bureaucracy .yes , I may have have a hand in design the scheme for local government in Scotland .I think it right then and I do now .I do not condone for one moment either the establishment , or the shockingly high salary that have be attach to those in local government service , produce a bureaucracy under which all Scotland be smart and which have contribute in no mean measure to the increase in support for the SNP .it be unrealistic to suggest that we can demolish that system of local government so recently set up .we could do so only after a considerable length of time and at further great expense .
22244-1976-01-19.8.1.157.3-conservative	in that connection , I be glad that the Government be now say that they will consider drop the dangerous proposal of a political veto exercise by the Secretary of State , but , despite that , I believe that the proposal will lead to extra bureaucracy , with administrative argument , lead to delay and increase cost , between the Secretary of State and his staff and the Executive and its staff .the Secretary of State will recruit more to his staff to produce argument against the Executive , and the Executive will recruit more staff to produce argument against the Secretary of State , and we shall thus have a considerable advance of bureaucracy .
22218-1976-01-19.8.1.165.7-labour	there have be an increase in the amount of work and the involvement of member in administration , but there have be a reduction in the power of Parliament to control the Executive and the bureaucracy .until 1957 , every Scottish Member be entitle to sit on the Committee stage of scottish Bills .I be a member of every Scottish Committee that deal with scottish legislation from 1946 to 1963 , and I be there as of right until 1957 .the Committees then consist of 84 or 85 member .the conservative cut down the number .

22005-1976-01-23.5.1.68.11-labour	the Government require local authority to produce long - term transport policy and programme .if we be to transfer responsibility for this to a new authority , whether at central , regional or local level , it would involve considerable upheaval and expense without any corresponding benefit .above all , at a time when we be try to cut back on bureaucracy we can see little merit in create an additional bureaucracy to be introduce between the Government and transport operator and user .on the other hand , we fully accept the need for great participation in decision - making , involve union , management , local government and consumer , on all aspect of transport policy .

18853-1976-01-26.8.1.6.4-conservative	the only thing that we can be sure of be that if the Bill go through there would be more bureaucracy and more highly pay job .no doubt we would see in the West Midlands County Council someone call the Director of Trading Services , probably on about £ 10,000 to £ 12,000 a year .no doubt there would be a Chief Officer for Bakeries , probably a £ 9,000 - a - year job .he would be not a mere master baker or master butcher but a dough insertion officer or bread extraction officer — perhaps more appropriately , a dough extraction officer .
16974-1976-01-26.8.1.46.6-labour	surely what we need be the maximum encouragement of local initiative and local enterprise .I do not want to see the kind of all - powerful monolithic , bureaucratic , remote State apparatus that Opposition member be rightly afraid of , I want to see local initiative , local enterprise and local democracy , not bureaucracy .

18622-1976-01-29.9.1.43.7-conservative	the Government be turn business into bureaucracy .they be seek to recreate industry in their own image .the Secretary of State for Employment have now abandon the concept of the right to work for the right to go on receive wage unrelated to any economic contribution .work be be divorce from production , cost from benefit , reward from performance .this be a recipe for 2 million unemployed .

22486-1976-01-30.4.1.4.12-conservative	my second main theme be to call for a more effective voice for the self - employ and the small business .I do not mean more interference and more bureaucracy .that be the last thing we want .talk to this section of the community the message come through loud and clear that they want the Government off their back , but that they need a more effective say before decision be make .

18184-1976-01-30.4.1.98.2-conservative	I be delighted that hon .member on both side have acknowledge the inherent value of smallness .this be so whether we be talk about business , about Government bureaucracy , about school and education or about local government .but it be of particular value in small business , especially at the local level , in human relation , good industrial relation , good communication , the in6ependence of the individual , the adaptability and flexibility of ( he small business , and good relation with the customer , as well as in the provision of a good deal of employment and the way in which the small business spur competition and create wealth .above all , however , the value of the small business lie in the way it stimulate innovation , a matter of profound significance for our future .

16836-1976-02-09.10.1.12.3-conservative	the proposal in this order be to give a privileged position to the BSC .in many respect the Corporation be already compete with a number of private producer of steel .those private producer be in a very difficult position , and , if their position be far undermined because they can not expand their plant , they can not buy a bit of land and they can not build a factory when the BSC have a privileged position in relation to the bureaucracy , once again we shall see that by a subterfuge , by a by - way , the Government be undermine the position of private industry .
21717-1976-02-10.8.1.77.5-liberal_democrats	I believe that if the piece of legislation now before the House proceed it can only lead to high dock levy , great bureaucracy , more unemployment and a lack of security for thousand of worker .there be a time when Labour support the worker , but it now appear that it be not the party of the worker but be the party of the dock worker .I suggest to the Government that they ought to have regard to the opinion of the wide cross - section of worker which have be express to they .
19212-1976-02-11.14.1.9.4-labour	as elsewhere , there have be a growth of bureaucracy in the West Midlands .in a speech at Eastbourne my right hon .friend the Prime Minister refer to an increase in the number employ in municipal job from 1·5 million 10 year ago to 2·5 million today .the West Midlands have share in this increase in local government employment , but service have not keep pace with the rise number of job .in many area service for the ordinary people have be reduce .

22010-1976-03-10.12.2.66.14-conservative	I come now to a relatively small part of public expenditure , that is , the size of the bureaucracy , for which I have some responsibility in the previous Conservative Government .since 1974 the size of the Civil Service — industrial and non - industrial — have go up by about 54,000 .I be convince that saving can be achieve .the saving envisage by the Government , so far as one can determine they , be about 20,000 or 30,000 poeple .

Meyer ) be quite right to draw our attention to the fact that possibly last night the Paymaster - General be the only honest man on the Treasury Bench because he quite rightly show the House that the present trend could not continue .there must be a transfer of resource back to the private sector .More than that , we must draw people out of the Civil Service and the bureaucracy , and get they back into private industry .I shall not criticise those people individually , because many be hard - work , worthy people , but not one be productive .it be only from production that we get profit and it be only out of profitability — I remind the hon .member for Coventry , South - West ( Mrs.Wise ) of this — that we can pay for the project and all those deserve cause which be so close to her heart .

17024-1976-03-12.4.1.51.2-labour	I be glad that my hon .friend have introduce this Bill , because it be of fundamental importance .one of the thing that I find disappointing as a Labour Member of Parliament be the sometimes our attitude adopt by many of my hon .friend towards the small business .I be an avid supporter of small business and be greatly concerned about the way in which they be harass by thing like value add tax .small business people in my constituency spend many hour of their time fill in form for the bureaucracy instead of be allow to develop in a creative way within the community .small business contribute greatly to the life of the community .
21956-1976-03-12.4.1.77.3-labour	it be not surprising that the co - operative movement be as well represent in this debate as so clearly be the case , because , as my hon .friend the Member for Aberdare ( Mr. Evans ) point out , the co - operative movement be found about 140 year ago on very much the same sort of principle as we be debate today .that be the principle that ordinary people ought to have some control over their own destiny and that they should not be merely pawn on a gigantic chess board on which the move be dictate either by the need of private profit or by some remote State bureaucracy .

17043-1976-03-12.10.1.2.11-conservative	in this miserable case of almost spiteful bureaucracy .I beg the Minister for heaven 's sake to show an override concern for those boy , Ian and John , and for Mr. Edwards , who have do so much over 25 year to bring up seven boy in urgent need of a loving , decent and christian home .

17822-1976-03-16.11.1.40.1-labour	up to a certain point we have support the coal industry by subsidy control and by taxation on oil .that taxation accrue to our Treasury and be redeploy for the benefit of our people .it be not hand over to a central bureaucracy for its purpose , which be quite a different matter .
19169-1976-03-18.12.1.12.3-conservative	the fruit of the Constitution Unit will be more government when we should have less and well government , more expenditure when we have to cut expenditure all round , more taxis when already the Chancellor of the Exchequer have say that we be an over - tax country and that there be not enough incentive because taxis be too high , and more civil servant , bureaucracy and red tape .I should have think that it be common ground between all sensible hon .member that already taxis be too high and civil servant too many , yet here we be waste all our time at this hour of the night discuss the work of a Unit which propose more government , more taxis , more public expenditure and more civil servant .it be absolutely ridiculous .
10396-1976-03-18.15.1.6.13-liberal_democrats	finally , there be the criticism which have be make — and again tonight — of the bureaucracy need to run the scheme .of course we need civil servant to pay out the subsidy and we should be subject to severe and proper criticism , in my judgment , if we do not ensure that the money be properly spend and account for .but we do not have to have an elaborate apparatus for the purpose .this be one of the attraction of the whole method of seek to assist the less well off .
19190-1976-03-22.8.1.16.13-liberal_democrats	it be little wonder that bureaucracy be Britain 's only growth industry .it be enormously wasteful in term of administration .it be a source of great bitterness and heartache for the lower - pay family , my hon .friend and I both represent part of the country where earning be well below the national average .every week people come into our surgery with their pay slip and point out illustration of this anomaly .it be true that for many of our constituent it just do not pay to work full time .

17208-1976-03-25.31.1.4.1-conservative	the opposition accept and welcome this measure .we believe that legal aid should be make available in this case .in do so , we note that the cost be state to be between £ 50,000 and £ 75,000 , and we note particularly that this Statutory Instrument relate to Scotland alone and be not an extension of present category .indeed , I think that it be worth mention that the level of entitlement to legal aid would be that of a person who earn not more than £ 1,790 , and that the entitlement be to be determine by a committee of lawyer .therefore , this be one case in which the lawyer concern will be save the State both the cost and the extra bureaucracy which would otherwise be require .I hope that that point will be bear in mind by the Government , the Royal Commission and all those who seek to criticise lawyer .

21715-1976-03-26.6.1.14.3-conservative	I would add that a reference to dictionary definition at the beginning of a speech usually mean that the speaker have a certain lack of confidence in his argument .although I be interested in what the hon .and learn Gentleman say , I be neither convince nor persuade by he .for all hon .member must know that a great many people be deeply worried about many aspect of the loss of personal freedom .those worry be sometimes express in way which be not wholly consistent with logical line of thought .for instance , much of the unease about the legislation on crash helmet and seat belt stem from the interference of bureaucracy , in all its form , in all kind of individual action rather than from the merit or demerit of the proposal themselves .recent experience have establish that the more bureaucracy we have , the bad it be .that be true at any level and in any type of bureaucracy .

10659-1976-03-26.6.1.22.13-conservative	the second institution that be threaten the freedom of the individual be , paradoxically , the House of Commons , with the nation under the leadership of the Labour Party .I refer particularly to the legislation which the House be pass , the extension of the bureaucracy , which it be cause , and the grow burden of taxation , all of which imply threat to our liberty .

21756-1976-03-26.6.1.73.9-labour	but we have to watch the situation , because bureaucracy be grow .the more complex society become , the more bureaucracy inevitably grow .often it have institute or develop tentacle which be design for our protection .none the less , where there be the growth of bureaucracy in any society , the individual can begin to suffer injustice and to be crush , because it be not always easy to attack a sprawl bureaucracy .therefore , there be danger in the diffusion of power from the House of Commons to other centre of power in this country .of course there be .we have to watch that .everyone who be vigilant be do a service to human liberty in this country .
18450-1976-03-26.6.1.75.3-conservative	it seem to I that the Inland Revenue 's record of threat of court proceeding at so early a stage be an altogether unwelcome piece of evidence of the aggressive attitude of the bureaucracy towards the citizen .I be not ask the Under - Secretary of State to take this up , because I be already in correspondence with the Treasury about it .

17986-1976-03-26.6.1.94.1-labour	I be sorry to interrupt an interesting development in the hon .Member 's argument .some of we have a rather nostalgic memory of a book which I believe he write back in the 1940 with Lord Hailsham outline the case for Conservatism .essentially he be deploy an argument not dissimilar from what we have hear this afternoon .he be rightly argue the case against bureaucracy , and that , certainly with the advantage of hindsight , I accept from the hon .member .but do he not agree that over the year that have pass since then the Labour movement , and especially the Labour Party , have take aboard what he say , hence the move for meaningful participation , worker ' control or industrial democracy , whatever it may be call , which be now a very big part of the political argument inside the Labour movement ?to that extent , therefore , we be oblige , to the hon .Gentleman , but the argument be a bit old hat .
22480-1976-03-26.6.1.95.15-conservative	nevertheless we must try to forecast , because one must have some basis on which to try to make any plan at all .the danger come — and this last point of mine be crucial — when authority , the Executive , the bureaucracy try to make its forecast come true by eliminate the unpredicability of people , by reduce the choice which they can make , by try to eliminate the uncertainty of the future , by try to lay down the strait and narrow path along which individual , family and community may move .
16443-1976-03-26.6.1.103.2-conservative	there be constant interference with private enterprise with price control , dividend restraint and officious meddling by bureaucracy , particularly in the administration of vat about which I have have endless complaint .see objectively , the record of the Chancellor as a candidate for leadership of a party which might actually increase freedom do not measure up to the hope that the hon .Member for Aberdare have for he .
22533-1976-03-26.6.1.107.5-labour	when we talk in term of the erosion of personal liberty , we think of other piece of Tory legislation in past year .it be the conservative who introduce legislation to cover water udertaking and to reorganise local government .against the background of such legislation I do not know how Opposition member can have the nerve to talk about the great threat to the freedom of the individual because of the growth of bureaucracy .the conservative proposal for local government reform have lead to more duplication of facility than have any other single act in history .I admire the nerve of Opposition member seek to lecture we on these problem and to complain about the multiplicity of form .
18354-1976-03-29.11.1.35.4-conservative	the debate will clearly cut across party line , as most european debate in this House do .with the referendum less than a year old , it would be surprising if many hon .member on either side of the House have change their view on the fundamental principle of membership of the European Community .those who be anti - marketeer be likely to oppose direct election because , in their view , presumably , they will be a further step down the road that they dislike .if rejection of direct election at this stage be to weaken the cohesion of the Community , I be sure that the anti - marketeer would welcome it , because they do not like the Community .but I should point out to they that if the Community be to continue — as it will — they should welcome more effective parliamentary control of the Brussels bureaucracy which they dislike so much .

19152-1976-03-29.11.1.124.2-labour	the alternative be clear and can be carry out literally tomorrow , or be develop after tomorrow , if the Government so wish .if we wish to control the bureaucracy and autocracy of Brussels , as we do , it must be , and ought to be , do on the basis of international cooperation because the federal rôle be supranational .the exist constitution of the Community be international through the Council of Ministers .the Council should be give power of de jure initiation .it should be able to initiate legislation , which I believe it can not do at the moment .

18175-1976-03-29.11.1.146.5-labour	in seek to answer that question , I should like to recall the argument widely use before and during the referendum campaign — above all , by those who be most opposed to our join the Community , include the hon .member for Banbury ( Mr. Marten ) and some of my hon .friend — to the effect that the Community be to be avoid because it be a bureaucratic , unrepresentative and undemocratic organisation .on the one hand , it be say to be an organisation in which a powerful bureaucracy — namely , the Commission — exercise a dominant position and be largely uninfluence by the view of the mass of the population of the Community or by the Assembly as it exist ; and , on the other hand , that the ultimate decision within the Community be reach by the Council of Ministers , which , in general , merely reflect the national interest of the Ministers ' own States and be equally uninfluence by any consideration of popular wish .

19212-1976-04-09.3.1.19.7-labour	secondly , I would reduce the crippling burden of bureaucracy in England .we should put the Civil Service on a rigorous cost - effective basis and , as a start , cut it back overnight by 30 per cent , to the level of 1964 .

18853-1976-04-28.12.1.10.9-conservative	equally damaging to local government be the Community Land Act .above all , it would be if it be ever to reach the second appoint day .it impose a duty which much of local government do not want .on the face of it , it increase local government power but I believe that it may do harm to local government .first , it will certainly arouse hostility and resentment as compulsory purchase spread .the power for takeover for genuine planning reason , after all , have exist since the 1971 Planning Act and , indeed , early than that .there be no reason for these additional power and they will inflame feeling where they be offer .it will add to the bureaucracy and cost , and we all know about that .
21720-1976-04-28.12.1.48.8-plaid_cymru	I find the anti - bureaucracy posture of the Conservative Opposition in the debate rather odd , because they arc the people who have create bureaucracy not only in local government but in the National Health Service , as well as in the water and sewerage service — particularly in that great monstrosity call the Welsh National Water Development Authority .it be urgent , in my view , for reason of bureaucracy and efficiency as well as for reason of answerability , that both local government and the all - Wales body , such as the water authority , should be restructure .

19156-1976-04-28.12.1.94.14-conservative	we certainly reject the approach of the Government .we believe that local authority should provide the wide range of social and environmental service at local level which they can do well than central Government or free enterprise .we believe that local government be a valuable check and balance on the power of the Government and central bureaucracy .we reject the social engineering concept which far too many socialist have put forward .

22493-1976-05-04.8.1.76.14-conservative	as a result of all this , I ask myself why it be that there be so much pressure to bring this measure forward .I can not help but think that this be a means of extend the grip of bureaucracy and Socialism into agriculture , which for year have be independent , with an independence of mind , spirit and action .agriculture have a proud record of independence .it be not so much that it be frantically wish by everyone to abolish tie house , although some concern have be show .in Scotland , as have be mention , 70 per cent .of farm worker live in tie house , yet there be no great clamour in Scotland , nor do the Bill claim to cover Scotland .the real move behind this measure be an attempt to control agriculture through control the mobility and availability of the labour force .
10647-1976-05-04.8.1.195.9-conservative	what about notification of disposal of a dwelling - house ?do this mean that bureaucracy will take control of all agricultural dwelling and , in turn , of agriculture as a whole ?how can livestock farmer plan long - term production with so much at risk at regard value of stock , when under the Bill so many people will be able to make or not to make decision that will directly effect the farming policy that they may wish to pursue ?

18971-1976-05-04.8.1.197.19-conservative	no one would deny that this be a situation that we must try to meet if we possibly can .in the past the problem have be meet relatively adequately by the device of possession order , force upon the local authority the need to rehouse where otherwise it would not .it be a rather fatuous device , in the sense that it put people to a lot of unnecessary expense .obviously , if one could find a way out of that , so much the well .but the Bill do not find a solution by create the bureaucracy that it create — the bureaucracy of these new consultative committee to which people will have to go , and the certificate that have to be send to the local authority , and so on .the consideration by the local authority when it have a case suddenly throw in its face will be on the question whether it should give priority to that family or to some other family .

21926-1976-05-12.3.13.3.1-conservative	do the Minister accept that an increase of nearly 2,000 in such a period be hardly the sort of increase which be acceptable in the present circumstance ?do he accept that this be a region of bureaucracy which lend itself to empire - building ?will he do his utmost to effect some sort of control so that this increase be not continue ?
22520-1976-05-12.3.13.4.1-labour	yes , I agree that the increase be totally unacceptable .of course , like the other reorganisation in which the hon .Member 's party become involve , this have , unfortunately , lead to an increase in bureaucracy .we have require the NHS authority to freeze their staff level at the figure prevail at the end of February 1976 because we be not prepared to accept an increase of this order .
21888-1976-05-13.11.1.7.2-conservative	the Government can change the situation merely by accept a proposal along the line suggest by my hon .Friend the Member for Braintree .that will be greatly to the benefit of the people concern and will bring a sense of justice to the Government 's dealing with elderly people .elderly people take the view that because they live alone and do not combine , they be attack on every hand by bureaucracy .they be attack because they seek to practise the virtue which use to be encourage , and indeed still be .those virtue involve thrift , hard work and responsibility , but be be grievously undermine by the principle put forward by the Chancellor .those deficiency could be remedied if the Government decide to accept this simple amendment .
19270-1976-05-17.7.1.24.6-conservative	I be puzzle about many aspect of this Bill .consequent upon what my hon .friend the Member for Kingston - upon - Thames ( Mr. Lamont ) have say , I be begin to wonder whether the lunch which we nave when we go out and be entertain or entertain other during our work as member of Select Committees ought not to be tax .after all , they be perk which we receive in the course of our work .perhaps they should be tax , too .if we be to tax these other people we should at least set a good example , along with the Chancellor , the Prime Minister , the Government Chief Whip and the civil servant and all the other part of the new establishment of the socialist egalitarian bureaucracy which leave the bureaucrat rich than anyone else .
16472-1976-05-18.11.1.20.8-conservative	even so , we only manage to sell 45,000 out of 5 million house in 1972 .yet all the evidence be that the demand be a great deal higher .there be very big difficulty in our way and some of these be technical .the apparatus and bureaucracy in local government make it extremely difficult to get through the process of valuation and the transfer of deed in the legal department within any reasonable time scale .then there be the problem of cost .even with 100 per cent .mortgage — at the time I be speak of , the average value of a house be £ 4,000 — and at a 10 per cent .mortgage rate , this be get on for £ 8 or £ 9 a week .even with a discount this be quite high .
16472-1976-05-18.11.1.20.11-conservative	there be no need for the authority to make fat profit .there will be a continue need for some council housing , but there be no need for the authority to make a big profit as long as it make sufficient to enable it to keep go .the aim should be to provide an equally good bargain for the tenant today as we could have provide in 1972 , and one which at the same time will help to dismantle some of the enormous bureaucracy which be engage in the management of local government housing .
16472-1976-05-18.11.1.20.16-conservative	I hope that my hon .friend the Member for Hornsey ( Mr. Rossi ) will not only endorse the human , social and economic factor which make for our advocacy of the sale of council house to tenant but will make it clear that neither bureaucracy nor inflation should defeat our purpose .we must , of course , lie it down that any tenant have the right to buy ; but we shall also have to take a quantum jump to make sure that he can exercise that right in practice .
18498-1976-05-18.11.1.43.9-labour	this be not an academic consideration .it be a matter that happen to have great relevance in all the new town .it mean not merely a transfer of asset from one authority to another , but the relating of decision - making to one authority .that be an important step .we shall thus avoid duplication and reduce , to some extent , the bureaucracy which inevitably arise with an agency such as a development corporation , however good it be .
10511-1976-05-18.11.1.49.6-labour	obviously , urgent repair will be tackle under the maintenance scheme , but what a tenant may consider urgent and what a local authority housing department inspector may consider urgent be an extremely subjective area .there be , therefore , considerable room for dispute .I be never sure about how London organise itself , but Birmingham be probably the large single housing authority in the country .certainly , in Birmingham we have the bureaucracy to go with it .
19392-1976-05-18.11.1.55.10-conservative	of course , I want to see fully - develop local government service .but my principal fear be that , in the transfer of housing stock from development corporation to district council , we shall see the buildup of a new bureaucracy at district coun- cil level which be not accompany by the disbandment of the exist bureaucracy of the successor of the development corporation .it be my great fear that we may build a duplication of bureaucracy and not see the elimination of one of they as a result of the assumption of power by another

16443-1976-06-07.39.1.1.11-conservative	I turn to the bureaucracy which we be create .this Government in particular have create a plethora of board , range from the absurd Rhubarb Advisory Board now to the Police Complaints Board .I be very much concerned about the extension of Prime Ministerial patronage that the Bill envisage , at a time when such patronage be already under sharp public scrutiny .after the honour list of the right hon .member for Huyton ( Sir H.

22529-1976-11-29.9.1.124.10-conservative	if one examine the way in which the Government be spend their money and consider the growth of bureaucracy over the last few year one get some idea of why we believe that public expenditure should be reduce .the number of additional people employ in education between 1974 and 1975 be 83,000 — a total of 1,776.000 now compare with 960,000 in 1961 .if anyone tell I that we be that much well educate than we be in 1961 I can not agree with he .
17853-1976-11-30.8.1.26.3-conservative	the only way of restore prosperity to Merseyside — the hon .member have some insight into this matter yesterday — be to do what be necessary in many other part of the country , namely , to begin sweep away the cobwebs of control and bureaucracy which have delay private sector recovery in Merseyside , Glasgow and Tower Hamlets for year , and to get back proper control of the management of the economy so as to bring down interest rate .
17433-1976-11-30.8.1.165.4-labour	the hon .Gentleman say : a future Tory Government would have nothing to do with the ' self - interested mafia who now prowl the upper reach of trade union bureaucracy ' … those well - heel prince of trade union officialdom ' have concern only for their own political power and appointment and none at all for their worker .
22555-1976-12-01.10.1.44.9-social_democratic_party	the Organising Committee have do an excellent job .it have make clear that British Shipbuilders will not be a decision - make centralised bureaucracy .local management be to retain a great deal of freedom .I hope that Vosper Thornycroft will retain its name .I think that have almost be agree .in such matter the Organising Committee have show a practical approach to its job .
10565-1976-12-02.10.1.98.2-conservative	I know that the hon .Lady may be able think only in term of bureaucracy , but I be suggest that the young have enough initiative to create their own work .they have only to look around the community to see what need do .alternatively , they can go to a job shop to find a list of voluntary organisation which need help .there be nothing impractical about that .it be be do already through the Job Creation Programme .
19473-1976-12-06.6.1.88.7-labour	the first monument of bureaucracy go wild be the Act to reorganise local government .it be a piece of monumental folly .it be promise that we should have more cost - effective local government .we have nothing of the kind .unfortunately , we do not seem able to alter it .have already stir thing up once , I be tell that we have to wait for the dust to settle before we can do anything about it .the next such monument be the Act to reorganise the National Health Service .the framework of that public service can be look at pretty critically in term of public expenditure .
10158-1976-12-06.6.1.121.2-labour	may I also say that conservative Members who now complain about this tax and the fact that we be use the National Insurance Scheme to raise the money should have give great thought to this problem when they introduce vat .if they have do so they would not have create a vast bureaucracy require 12,000 civil servant to raise a sum which could have be raise much more easily .the Conservative Party when in Government could have impose few burden on industry have they not introduce the complex vat system .
21969-1976-12-06.8.1.12.1-conservative	— my hon .friend the Member for Banbury ( Mr. Marten ) call it etatism , and not unjustly — into the sphere of purely domestic concern which , if it be not check , will be rapidly extend and accompany by the growth in the vested interest in the bureaucracy which inevitably come with it .
19152-1976-12-06.8.1.18.3-labour	there be surely no need to have a colossal bureaucracy learn all the intricacy of the complicated matter of water supply , go through many official consultation and to some expense to reach a standard of water which might be well assess by the WHO anyway .
22049-1976-12-07.9.1.34.20-conservative	the image of nationalisation abroad be understandably dreadful and the recent NEDO report reinforce that image abroad .I shall not detain the House by go through that report , but we all know that the NEDO report be absolutely right about the nationalise industry .their giant bureaucracy with constant arguing and change to their system of management be absolutely the bad form of organisation for a highly skilled , fragmented industry like ship repair .there could not be a bad form of organisation for that industry .
22553-1976-12-07.9.1.141.1-conservative	the evidence be that at present foreign government and customer be able to order british warship either directly with a yard or company or through the Ministry of Defence .in the overwhelming majority of case where order have be make they have be make directly with the yard .that indicate clearly that foreign customer wish to deal directly with the company or yard where they have an ongoing relationship and a presence during the period of design and construction rather than to deal with a governmental bureaucracy .the hon .Gentleman ask for an example and that be my answer .I believe that it be a real answer .
22049-1976-12-07.9.1.171.1-conservative	we be now get proof that many Labour member do not believe in the private ownership of industry and the mixed economy .if the State spend 60 per cent .of GNP , one can see how easily the remain 40 per cent .could be gobble up .let we consider the amount of paper use in this place and throughout our bureaucracy .it lead I to wonder whether the paper industry should be one of the first to be nationalise .
22049-1976-12-07.9.1.179.2-conservative	as for pricing policy , I go along with the hon .gentleman in as much as part of the loss be due to those policy , but that be not the only reason .these loss be due partly to pricing policy but also to the inefficiency that be build into the bureaucracy of the system .so far as this relate to pricing policy , it result from political interference .
10289-1976-12-10.12.7.13.1-conservative	the hon .Member have put his finger on the point .we be talk essentially about local authority money , so , while the Department may be anxious to spend its own money , it can not spend other people 's quite so readily .this be a matter , as I indicate in the case of Portsmouth , where one must rely essentially on local autonomy .I be sure that the hon .Gentleman , who be undoubtedly no Stalinist , would not want to impose on people a huge bureaucracy which force they to do locally that which they would not want to do of their own accord .
19284-1976-12-13.6.1.50.2-conservative	I turn to a third point — not so much a constitutional point as a point about the cost of the bureaucracy .what the Government have manage to do be to ensure that their propose Welsh Assembly have far few power than the Scottish Assembly .the run cost of the Welsh Assembly will be far more than that of the Scottish Assembly .the capital cost of the Welsh Assembly will be £ 3·8 million and the cost of the Scottish Assembly £ 4 million .although the Welsh Assembly would have far few power , its annual cost would exceed the cost of the Scottish Assembly .a large number of extra people will be take on for it .I understand that when that be add to the forecast increase in the number of civil servant , in Scotland there will be a total of 14,000 in 1978 and in Wales a total of 2,720 .it make the EEC Commission , which employ only 7,810 people , look very economical by contrast .
19284-1976-12-13.6.1.50.3-conservative	the demand have be for much less government .the response have be more government , more member of Parliament , more bureaucracy , and more cost .
14158-1976-12-13.6.1.51.1-labour	the right hon .Lady be understate her case .the cost for each Assembly man in Wales and his support be say to be £ 31,250 per annum , but that be on the basis that there will be a share Civil Service — something which will never come about with a Welsh Assembly , which will be jealous of its power .therefore , despite the advice which the right hon .Lady have receive , she have considerably underestimate the massive bureaucracy which will be impose on Wales if the Bill be pass .
21924-1976-12-13.6.1.62.7-labour	with these three the case for further reconsideration become necessary , but it become more difficult .I believe that more than two and a half year ' experience of all three — local government , health and water — have confirm the warning we then give .there be increase dissatisfaction all over the country , and when concern be express , for example in the context of public expenditure , or anxiety be express about the growth of local government bureaucracy , let none seek to underrate the importance of these so - call local government reform two and a half to three year ago in increase both public expenditure and bureaucracy throughout local government .
22033-1976-12-13.6.1.65.1-conservative	be the right hon .Gentleman , with all the authority of a former Prime Minister , seriously try to suggest to the House that the way to reduce remoteness and to deal with the problem of bureaucracy be to set up massive regional authority ?
21904-1976-12-13.6.1.108.9-labour	equally obvious be the advantage of decentralisation and human scale structure from the standpoint of democracy .decentralisation be the condition of a truly participate democracy .the power of the people in Britain be small in comparison with the power of bureaucracy because in centralist States the power almost inevitably get into the hand of the bureaucrat .what we have here be a country whose government have a bureaucratic character .Lord Hailsham be quite right when he say the other day that the power of government be now largely in the hand of the government machine .
17345-1976-12-13.6.1.124.8-conservative	"""this bring I to the main difference between the """" Tory """" Assembly and the """" Labour """" Assembly .leave aside matter of technicality , detail to be resolve , amendment to be table and so on , the real difference be an Assembly with or without an Executive .return to the spectrum I mention early , if we do not stop around the Douglas - Home proposal but move on to the type of Assembly call for in this Bill , we introduce element of stress and strain which would necessitate go far to a quasi - federal solution with money - raise power and a Bill of Rights .for these reason we on the Tory Benches say that the Assembly should be another chamber of Parliament , without any bureaucracy or further layer of government ."""
17303-1976-12-13.6.1.186.7-conservative	I know that the Bill aim to set up two parliament and have be rightly criticise for this very fact , but it be the effect of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament on my region just south of the border to which I should like now to address myself .it have already be say , but can not be over - state , that this measure will lead to an extra layer of bureaucracy .it will also lead to considerable cost .accord to the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum , £ 3 million will be spend on set up the two Parliaments , £ 25 million on annual salary and £ 8 million on capital account .
17303-1976-12-13.6.1.186.8-conservative	we be present with those startling figure at a time of grave economic crisis .accord to my morning paper , before the week be out we may be tell of further expenditure cut include defence — which I hope my party will resist .yet we be tell that these figure will be spend on create an extra layer of bureaucracy .
17303-1976-12-13.6.1.186.16-conservative	perhaps in future it might be wise to bring all these body together .perhaps in time to come we can evolve some form of regional authority , but it should be as a replacement for a tier of authority , not an addition to it .an extra tier of bureaucracy in Scotland and Wales or any of the region of England , be completely unnecessary and highly expensive .the people be feed up with over - much interference .they want less , not more , government .
22114-1976-12-13.6.1.236.6-labour	therefore , I find myself in a very great dilemma about whether we should simply let this Bill go through and face the possibility that in a decade we shall be set up a Royal Commission to decide how to get rid of the Scottish Assembly .in my view , we be not improve democracy by lop off a bit of bureaucracy which exist in Whitehall and transplant it firmly to Edinburgh and hope that , somehow , it will become more democratic in the process .we may simply be transplant something which will grow even big as a result .
19004-1976-12-13.6.1.254.12-conservative	we have hear in the debate a great deal of criticism of the detail — indeed more than just the detail — of the Bill .the creation of an Executive for the Scottish Assembly have be criticise as bring with it a series of inherent tension between that Assembly and Westminster and also in its train an unnecessarily burdensome bureaucracy and expense .
19004-1976-12-13.6.1.258.2-conservative	this Bill should in theory create small unit of government that be more local and more responsive , but I find that as draft it will create big battalion of bureaucracy .the answer be that we should have start by look at scottish local government .that opportunity have , unfortunately , pass we by .my hon .friend the Member for Aberdeenshire , West ( Mr. Fairgrieve ) cover this aspect of the matter extremely well and I believe that what he say would repay careful study , because if we be to satisfy the objective of devolution without create bureaucracy we must look at the whole gamut of government from Brussels right down to the local level to make sure that we get the relationship of Government , of the Assemblies and of official right .it be because we have not start with that organisation of local government that it will be so difficult to put the Bill right and put it into a form that will be acceptable to get the approval of the House on Third Reading .
10591-1976-12-14.14.1.10.6-conservative	as my hon .friend the Member for Edinburgh , Pentlands ( Mr. Rifkind ) point out in the White Paper debate , the Conservative Party have oppose consistently the establishing of a separate Executive or Government in Scotland , largely on account of the over - government and additional bureaucracy it would create ; but to have a separate Government without any revenue raise power , as the Bill propose , would be to sow seed of frustration and disillusionment throughout Scotland .
10591-1976-12-14.14.1.12.4-conservative	another major objection be the bureaucracy involve in the scheme .it be considerable .the new arrangement be calculate to involve the employment of an extra 2,300 civil servant , a considerable number .in the case of Wales the number be expect to rise .at a time when Government Departments and local authority be be oblige to cut staff in almost every field of activity , the proposal seem ludicrous .there be not even a suggestion that the public in Scotland or Wales will benefit from well public service .in fact , it be pretty clear that , at least in the foreseeable future , the level and quality of public service will be reduce because of the Government 's other policy .
21823-1976-12-14.14.1.13.1-scottish_national_party	the hon .gentleman talk about increase bureaucracy and expense .will he do the House the courtesy , which the Leader of the Opposition do not do , of answer the question put by the Leader of the Liberal Party ?what be his party 's view ?what be its concrete proposal ?
10591-1976-12-14.14.1.16.10-conservative	"""perhaps the most interesting poll of all be the one which show that a year ago 10 per cent .of scot have never hear of the Government 's proposal and that this month 28 per cent .have never hear of the Government 's proposal .perhaps some people be """" switch off """" , but it would certainly not surprise I if the people of Scotland , when they realise what the Government 's scheme will involve in extra taxis , over - government and , extra bureaucracy , show less enthusiasm than they have up to now for the Scotland and Wales Bill ."""
18267-1976-12-14.14.1.132.18-conservative	the second thing which have cause the increase in nationalist feeling be the increase remoteness of government , not in the physical sense but in the sense of understanding and care less and less about what people be do , what they mind about and what concern they .to many , the Bill make it bad .it increase the bureaucracy and remoteness of government by introduce yet one more tier .it forget one important point , particularly in deal with Wales .I refer to the error which have be make , in copy the method by which local government work , in make the Welsh Assembly itself the Executive .
21904-1976-12-14.14.1.146.3-labour	we must draw attention to the fact that there be now in Wales great feeling and anxiety because there appear to be a degree of over - government .we have community council , district council , county council , the Welsh Office , ad hoc authority , Westminster , and the EEC bureaucracy which have now be add in recent year .we be now to have a Welsh Assembly insert into the other tier of government .we also have the semantic argument about whether the Welsh Assembly be another tier of government .it appear to I that it be .if it be to add yet another tier , it be a matter that we should examine closely .
19169-1976-12-14.14.1.163.2-conservative	the major error of the Bill have be mention many time .these point have be make many time because they be true .they be point which strike home .the Bill mean more government when almost everyone believe that we need less government .we shall have six layer of government and be the most over - govern country in the world .the Bill mean more bureaucracy and more civil servant when everyone agree that we need few .
16771-1976-12-14.14.1.253.8-conservative	I agree , therefore , with the right hon .Member for Belfast , East that we can conclude that government in Britain , at central and local level , have become increasingly inefficient and remote as the bureaucracy that fatten on it have be allow to grow , but I draw very different conclusion from those that he lay before the House .for the life of I , I can not see how add another tier of authority and thousand more bureaucrat in Scotland and Wales will improve these matter .I should have think that they would inevitably add to inefficiency and that the sort of Assembly envisage in the Bill would lead to frustration and discontent of a kind that would enable the Scottish National Party to continue to thrive and to move towards the inevitable conclusion that only complete separation be the answer .I see that I carry with I in that the hon .member for Dunbartonshire , East ( Mrs. Bain ) .if that be so what a mess of pottage to put before a serious deliberative Assembly .
16771-1976-12-14.14.1.257.4-conservative	the grant system propose in the Bill give the bad of all world to Scotland and Wales .it will do nothing to strengthen grass - root local government .it will encourage the growth not of real devolve responsibility but of endless bickering about the meanness of the central Government while do nothing about the growth of unproductive bureaucracy .
21848-1976-12-14.14.1.265.3-labour	in Scotland and Wales there be an overwhelming case for a referendum before the Bill proceed .in my view the overwhelming majority of people in Wales would vote for the retention of the status quo .they would argue , rightly , that to replace the county council with this super - tier of local government would be of little or no advantage to they .they would see an extra tier of local government involve extra cost and more bureaucracy .
10011-1976-12-14.14.1.297.19-labour	what about the nominate body ?it be easy to raise a cheer at a party conference when talk about the several nominate body as be wholly unresponsible and in need of be bring within some form of democratic control .even if that case be cite , we do not have to create the whole paraphernalia suggest in the Bill to control they .we could do the same thing by have , for example , a Welsh Council compose of mps or possibly senior representative from the local government structure .it could sit at an all - Wales level without create the bureaucracy , the rival government and all the danger in the structure suggest by the Government .
17442-1976-12-14.14.1.334.3-conservative	the next problem be that of unresponsive remote bureaucracy .successive british government be widely think to have be guilty of these undesirable characteristic in the way they have seek to govern the country , and this criticism have be apply as much to local as to national government .
17442-1976-12-14.14.1.336.3-conservative	if we turn to the problem of unresponsive and remote bureaucracy , in so far as this be an institutional failing it can be susceptible to institutional remedy .for example , the remoteness of Government could be counter by devolve more power and responsibility to exist local authority .the bureaucracy of government could be counter by a self - deny ordinance on the part of this House against the passage of all legislation which would extend the sphere of the public sector , require the establishment of public body or make the Welfare State more complicated than it have already become .
16425-1976-12-14.14.1.407.2-conservative	it be easy to spot a wrong'un when one see it , but it be not enough to call the Lord President 's Bill a bad one without go over a few of its bad point .many hon .member have rightly call the Bill a recipe for conflict .so it be — first , conflict between Cardiff and Westminster ; second , conflict between the Assembly and the Secretary of State ; third , conflict between this propose form of overblown bureaucracy and other Ministeries , fourth , conflict between Wales and England .
16425-1976-12-14.14.1.407.4-conservative	so everyone know that it be a bad Bill .it can lead only to separatism .I as a Welshman reject that because of the great benefit that the unity of the United Kingdom have bring to all of we in these british island .I be a Welshman .I hope I be a patriotic Welshman .I be also a Briton , and a patriotic Briton .I be a european , and I hope a patriotic European .can the Lord President make the same proud claim ?no , he be not a Welshman and he be a well - know and passionate adversary of the European Community , if windy rhetoric be a true reflection of passion .I tell the right hon .gentleman through the Minister of State that my pride in be a Welshman need no footling Assembly in Cardiff to sustain I , no costly piece of bumble bureaucracy between Parliament and the people .I speak with feeling because I be basically in favour of devolution — that is , real devolution .
16425-1976-12-14.14.1.411.4-conservative	when this gift - wrap package have be open it will be see for what it be — namely , a cumbersome piece of costly bureaucracy to be put between the people and their elect representative .the people will have none of it .that be why the Prime Minister waffle around the question of a referendum on Monday .such great measure of constitutional reform should be base on consensus , not on expediency .
10386-1976-12-14.14.1.417.7-conservative	I have not find one voter in my constituency who want anything of this kind .there be already a tremendous feeling that the regional health authority and the Anglian Water Authority be as remote as Westminster be from the people of Norfolk .they feel that a regional assembly would simply perpetuate this .it would add new tier of government when we want few .it would increase the bureaucracy when we must cut down the number of people in the unproductive public sector .
16393-1976-12-14.14.1.433.2-conservative	"""what I ask first be : what be the intention and purpose of devolution ?if we be to make a major constitutional change we should start out with an objective .what be the purpose of these change , if we be to make any ?surely the purpose must be the improvement of government .how do we improve government ?if we read the Kilbrandon Report , which many people seem not to have manage to read before reach this point — certainly they have not read its conclusion — we find that paragraph 123 say that any reform of our system of government must recognise that one of the main development of the twentieth century have be the vast expansion of bureaucracy .the evidence reveal , follow analysis , that people feel : | """" ( a ) lack of effective two - way communication between government and govern .| ( b ) a widespread concern for a great share in .or influence on , government decision - making .| ( c ) dissatisfaction arise from a large body or unresolved individual grievance against central and local government and the service for which central government have ultimate responsibility — the nationalise industry , the health service , etc .

22141-1976-12-15.30.1.50.27-conservative	it be always at that point that the Secretary of State , and , indeed , the Lord President , confront with the undeniable increase in cost and bureaucracy , declare that it be all justified , and that it will be a source of joy to the people because it will represent more democratic government .labour politician , and particularly the Lord President himself , usually use that phrase , and couple it with a good deal of abuse of the Conservative Party , at a moment when they be about to do something profoundly democratic .therefore we be always a little sceptical about these assurance .
17823-1976-12-15.30.1.94.1-liberal	it be suggest then that there would be a great growth of bureaucracy in Wales .I think that it be a mistake by the Conservative Opposition .the Conservatives do not take a dispassionate view .the creation of the Welsh Office be a valuable contribution , and its development under successive Secretaries of State have be of considerable advantage to Wales .
17823-1976-12-15.30.1.94.6-liberal	the Secretary of State should address himself to the consequent great fear in Wales that the Government 's proposal will lead to a considerable addition to bureaucracy and officious meddling and supervision of local government by the Assembly .it be suggest that it will be costly and virtually another tier of local government .the right hon .and learn Gentleman remark that my right hon .friend the Member for Devon , North ( Mr. Thorpe ) once say of the power propose for the Welsh Assembly that they would provide for a glorify Glamorgan County Council .he suggest that in many quarter that would be regard as a tribute .I do not know about that , but I know that in many quarter that comparison would be regard as highly defamatory .my right hon .friend be right in that there be a fear that an Assembly with the power that be propose will have a good deal of ability to meddle in local government and will prove extremely costly .
17691-1976-12-15.30.1.102.8-conservative	support for the Bill come from those who for personal , party , or power advantage believe that its content will camouflage the real malaise from which we suffer — inflation , over - spending , over - borrowing and over - tax at the tragic expense of the hard - working and the unemployed .yet the Bill be costly in term of bureaucracy , further taxation and yet another layer of government superimpose upon the 5 million Scots who would then be the most over - govern people in the western world .

21684-1976-12-20.7.1.10.4-labour	I think that it would be right for a class of special company to be create which could be exempt from the great mass of bureaucracy and regulation that face industry and commerce .after the Bolton Report of 1971 , my hon .friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury ( Mr. Ridley ) be appoint Minister with special responsibility for small business .I believe that the present holder of a comparable appointment be the hon .member for Keighley ( Mr. Cryer ) .that appointment seem to be a calculated insult to the private sector in view of the fact that the hon .Gentleman 's political career have be dedicate to the disparagement of private company .the only comfort be that his effort on behalf of small business have be so inconspicuous that a week ago today at Question Time his hon .friend the Member for St. Helens ( Mr. Spriggs ) have to ask he who really be the Minister responsible for small business .by contrast , my hon .friend the Member for Basingstoke ( Mr. Mitchell ) have be a far more powerful advocate of the interest of small business than have any Government Minister , and to have do that from the Opposition Benches be a highly creditable performance .
21684-1976-12-20.7.1.14.2-labour	morale in small business be low , and it have be lower partly by this unnecessary burden of paperwork and bureaucracy .the Government 's tax and pay policy treat skilled and qualified people , such as manager and accountant , as some sort of criminal against society .their effort and success be penalise and resent as anti - social .these be the people whom we should encourage .their energy should be devote to manufacturing and selling , but already there be a big credibility gap about the Government 's industrial strategy and unless they do something about this problem , it will get very much bad .
21684-1976-12-20.7.1.14.4-labour	those in industry can no long afford the burden in money or time of respond to the interference by the Government .they be gradually be suffocate by the avalanche of rule and regulation .if the Government be not careful , british business will soon become the Pompeii of the twentieth century , smother and fossilise by the endless eruption of our bureaucracy .I hope that the motion will commend itself not only to the House but to the Government before the damage become irreparable .
18007-1976-12-20.7.1.17.2-united_kingdom_independence_party	I be sure , Mr. Deputy Speaker , that you be aware that there be not an hon .member who could not produce the same kind of letter , except that we on this side of the House recognise that most of those who write such letter be politically motivated and inspire and that what they say bear no relation to the fact .the hon .Gentleman be attempt to produce evidence to show the damage cause to industry .in fact , he do not mention the word damage during his speech and he have not show any of the damage that have be cause to industry and commerce by an excess of Government bureaucracy .we have have no illustration of the damage to either industry or commerce .we have have no indication of the so - call excess of bureaucracy .I be sure that there be an excess of bureaucracy .I be sure , too , that there be a little fat in the Civil Service that we could pare .but the hon .Gentleman do not illustrate it .he do not indicate specifically and directly the area in which we should be pare the size of the bureaucracy .
18007-1976-12-20.7.1.25.10-united_kingdom_independence_party	if we be talk about bureaucracy — one of the word in the motion — let we also talk about the private , irresponsible , anonymous bureaucracy in multinational company .they be bureaucracy , too , and no different from public bureaucracy except that they exercise far great power than public bureaucracy and they be accountable to no one .they can close down factory in my constituency at a moment 's notice , blight the livelihood of whole family and bring gloom and despair to town such as Skelmersdale and Kirkby with no thought of the social consequence of their action .
18007-1976-12-20.7.1.25.13-united_kingdom_independence_party	the hon .member for Hitchin speak about bureaucracy , but his only substantial complaint be about a firm which have to count its tree before it could get £ 2,000 from the Government for a computer .what a miserable condemnation of the capitalist system .instead of talk about the real issue which confront this country and its people and the job and livelihood which be at stake , he can complain only that , in order to get £ 2,000 from the taxpayer , this poor , little , piddle firm have to answer a few question .
18007-1976-12-20.7.1.25.27-united_kingdom_independence_party	it be disgraceful that such company can take such a slight or dim view of their responsibility to a town that have serve they well over the last decade .such a company as Albright and Wilson or Control Dataset can , almost at a moment 's notice , exercise the private , irresponsible , anonymous power of which we have talk — and the bureaucracy of which the hon .Gentleman should have talk but do no — make a decision for its own private interest .which be never accountable and will never be justify — it will never have to give its reason in this place — which will control the livelihood of my constituent and demoralise a whole town , with no care for the social fabric of the area or region .
22486-1976-12-20.7.1.31.5-conservative	too much effort be deflect from wealth production , export , after - sale service and good management .too much energy run into the sand in unproductive paper work and in comply with regulation that make the law look an ass and almost invite evasion .too many people have give up in despair , take the view that if they can not beat bureaucracy , they have well join it .far too many of we be mind each other 's busine on behalf of Government instead of produce wealth for the community as a whole .
10560-1976-12-20.7.1.35.2-conservative	what will determine the future of our economy and our society be the attitude we adopt as a country towards business and the creation of wealth .we do not claim that over - bureaucracy — the burden place upon business by red tape and form - filling — be the only deterrent to the efficient running of business and suc- cessful investment .we make the point that it be an inhibit factor .anyone who think that the multitude of red tape be an irrelevanace as the hon .member for Ormskirk ( Mr. Kilroy - Silk ) seem to imply , should attempt to export to Japan .it be become almost a truism to say that in attempt to export to that country it be not overt barrier which present problem but the amount of red tape .clearly , this multitude of red tape be an important factor .
10560-1976-12-20.7.1.35.3-conservative	there be other factor which affect business , too .for instance , our manager be more highly tax than any other set of manager in the western world .in addition , when we aggregate all form of taxation , business in this country be tax more heavily than practically any other industrialise country .those be add factor but the bureaucracy item be a most important element in all of this .I hope that the Minister will at least accept this and move on from there to discuss what can be do .
10560-1976-12-20.7.1.35.5-conservative	we find as a result of all this that rebate in connection with export service be treat differently from those arise from manufacture .a whole compendium of question arise .anyone try to export service be rapidly make aware of the heavy hand of bureaucracy as he seek to discover which aspect of his service be zero - rate , which aspect be exempt and which carry vat , which , incidentally , act as a form of discrimination .
10560-1976-12-20.7.1.37.1-conservative	this be a personal opinion , but I believe that a price and income policy be a perfect example of what I mean .a price code be one of the cost to industry which the hon .Member discount .he never try to quantify those cost in term of job lose .a price and income code be a perfect example of a bureaucratic operation that do not further the end the hon .gentleman claim he wish to far — namely , the creation of more job and great prosperity .I be not in the House at the time of the Conservative Government 's price and income policy and can not answer the question in personal term .but we have here a perfect example of a legislative framework which result in the most appalling discrimination and bureaucracy , particularly concern price .
17403-1976-12-20.7.1.51.2-conservative	the Industrial Training Act have produce in many case a massive unnecessary bureaucracy of form filling .
18287-1976-12-20.7.1.59.8-labour	I , as a Socialist , believe in planning , and anybody who attempt to equate planning with bureaucracy be do a disservice to the political argument and condemn socialism in a way that be most unfair .I believe in a plan economy .I believe that it be necessary for the State to have information in order to undertake proper planning .the State need to be able to exert an influence and to try to ensure that there be movement in a certain direction .therefore , it be valid for the State to ask for information .
10327-1976-12-20.7.1.82.8-labour	the hon .member for Somerset , North ( Mr. Dean ) be an extremely effective Minister at the Department of Health and Social Security , a Department which multiply bureaucracy as few other have , through the reorganisation of the National Health Service .I be sure that he and his right hon .friend do not want to augment and multiply bureaucracy in do what they think be a very proper reform of National Health Service administration , but act of Government which do not of themselves seek to multiply bureaucracy often quite unwittingly or unwillingly have such effect .in look at the way in which Government bureaucracy operate , one have to see what one can do to stop the momentum .
18622-1976-12-21.9.4.4.21-conservative	next there be the problem of bureaucracy .yesterday my hon .friend the Member for Hitchin ( Mr. Stewart ) describe in a remarkable speech all the bureaucracy and rule and regulation in industry .the Minister of State , Department of Industry describe what he say , which be echo by every business man in the country , as trivial and pathetic .
10158-1976-12-23.16.1.6.5-labour	the right hon .Gentleman ask why we have to do it .we have to do it because we be constantly ask to reduce the bureaucracy .I do not mean the bureaucracy of national saving , but Government bureaucracy .the right hon .Gentleman be Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee — I serve on it under he — and he will know that we have be ask to reduce current expenditure on the bureaucracy .I remind the House that the withdrawal of 570 support staff be part of a decision by the Government to effect a reduction of 26,000 in the Civil Service in general .we be not single out the voluntary movement .this have to be see in the context of a reduction in saving of about £ 95 million and a reduction of 26,000 in total in central Government bureaucracy .the 570 support staff be part of that decision .
10158-1976-12-23.16.1.6.6-labour	it do not emanate from the Page Report or from anything except a need — which I be sure the right hon .gentleman recognise — to do something to keep down the growth of the bureaucracy .it be easy to state that principle but very difficult to apply the priority without hurt different section and different area .unfortunately , the Government have to make a decision and look at all department .
10158-1976-12-23.16.1.6.8-labour	it be not part of an attack on the voluntary movement .it be part of a much large problem of contain the growth of the bureaucracy .it would be wrong for I to hold out any hope that the decision can in any way be reverse .the Prime Minister write to Sir John Anstey on 5th August 1976 state that he be afraid there be no scope for reconsideration .Lord Elgin , in Scotland , have be inform in exactly the same term .
19500-1976-12-23.20.1.2.1-labour	when the National Health Service come into be in 1948 , Britain lead Europe in post - war recovery .we top every worthwhile table and become at the same time the Welfare State , the envy of the world .then , from 1951 we have 13 year of conservative government , during most of which time Britain spend a low percentage of its national income on health welfare and social security provision than do its neighbour .that fact , together with the frustrating , time - consume bureaucracy bring into be by the reorganisation of the National Health Service enact by the last Conservative Government , produce an ailing , demoralise Health Service which be in crisis at the time the minority Labour Government come to power in 1974 to face the bad post - war , world - wide slump , with Britain be leave disastrously unprepared for it by the outgoing Conservative Government .

19169-1977-01-13.10.1.14.2-conservative	an Assembly will mean more civil servant .almost all hon .member believe that we have too great a bureaucracy already , and yet here we be , at one step , add another 1,000 civil servant by the Bill .our experience of local government reform — indeed , of almost every reform — be that it increase the number of civil servant .that be another reason why many people in Scotland , as over the coming month they more closely consider what the Bill mean , will reject it .the Bill mean more government , more civil servant and more expenditure .the Government be desperately try to cut public expenditure and yet they bring forward a Bill that increase public expenditure , which will inevitably lead to high taxation .
16404-1977-01-13.10.1.80.5-scottish_labour_party	I turn to the argument deploy by the hon .member for West Lothian ( Mr. Dalyell ) .the argument he advance against the establishment of a Scottish Assembly could have be employ against the Common Market and direct election , and indeed against the establishment of a European Assembly in Strasbourg .it be another layer of government and involve another degree of bureaucracy .it involve the election of further member of Parliament and all that go with it .surely if one be argue for european democracy , as my hon .friend do in the Common Market campaign , those matter be irrelevant .they be the price one have to pay .similarly we believe that this be a worthwhile price to pay to achieve certain democratic change inside Scotland for the well government of Scotland .
10591-1977-01-13.10.3.50.7-conservative	we have make it clear that we regard these proposal as objectionable and dangerous .my belief be that if we can get down to the detailed consideration the people of Scotland will begin to realise , as the Conservative Opposition have do , that the Government 's proposal be damaging and dangerous , and will bring about over - government and too much bureaucracy .the more we can tell the people of Scotland what the Government 's scheme will mean for they and of the failure inherent in it , the well it will be for those who , like the Conservative Party , stand firmly by the Union .

22141-1977-01-18.6.1.28.8-conservative	at the end of the day , the disillusionment — indeed , the bitterness — of Mr. and Mrs. Average Welshman at be mislead will be very considerable .despite the great expectation that have be raise , most people simply will not notice any difference about their relationship with the nominate body .what they will notice be the cost and bureaucracy of the Assembly .
22141-1977-01-18.6.1.28.10-conservative	it be repeatedly deny that the Bill will produce another tier of Government .what can not be deny be that it will produce a massive increase in the bureaucracy .the Secretary of State love to tell we that the price of democracy be worth pay .but it be not democracy that we be go to be pay for — it be bureaucracy .at a time when we need less government , we be go to have more of it ; at a time when we need simplicity , we be go to have complexity ; at a time when we need economy , we be go to have extravagance ; at a time when we need unity , we be go to have division .
22067-1977-01-19.3.10.5.1-labour	in these discussion have any local authority mention the conservative policy of abolish the domestic rate ?will my right hon .friend seek detail of that policy , satisfy himself that industry will not face hefty extra burden , and ensure that there will be no extra growth in bureaucracy ?
16836-1977-01-19.3.13.5.1-conservative	would the Minister agree that the hope of the West Midlands for the future will rest upon profitable private industry and not on move a number of job and try to swell the already over - burden rank of the bureaucracy ?
17605-1977-01-19.9.1.4.11-liberal	when the devolution Bill be produce my constituent see the danger of be dominate by the central belt of Scotland .they see that there would be no reduction in the size of either Westminster government or local government and that an Edinburgh government would be simply a new tier add far to their burden .the apparent contradiction in view between those hold at the election and now be a result of the change in the political scene .the people have watch the immense growth in bureaucracy , they know that our economic nationally be in a serious muddle , and they doubt whether this be the time to embark upon constituential change .
19169-1977-01-19.9.3.199.3-conservative	as many hon .member have say in the past , and will continue to say as the Bill progress , there be nothing wrong with hammer home a point simply because it have be make before .we should convince the people of this country , and the repetition and hammer home of the basic point will achieve the realisation that extra cost and extra bureaucracy be involve and that the unity of the United Kingdom be be imperille .this be a recipe for conflict and discontent .
10647-1977-01-19.9.3.252.8-conservative	I repeat that devolution be threaten the unity of this country , which have be form and formulate since 1707 .in an age in which the process of government be already discredit and overburden , it seem incredible that a Government of the United Kingdom should support the creation of yet another tier of bureaucracy .I say that as a totally unabashed Conservative .my party have traditionally be the party of the Union .I be proud to say that , and I shall repeat it during the next few month on many public platform up and down the country .long may the Conservative Party be the party of the Union .not for nothing be it still affectionately call the conservative and Unionist Party .
18946-1977-01-20.11.1.6.12-labour	another important issue for I be the extent to which it will be desirable to restrain road traffic in town .congestion have not increase to the extent that many people fear it would five or 10 year ago , but a degree of restraint be inevitable if the heart of our city be not to be tear out by expensive and destructive road building .policy on traffic management and the application of parking control be rightly a matter for local decision and local option .in devise they and in implement they in way the public accept , we must seek to strike a balance .I do not welcome excessive regulation , and all the apparatus that go with bureaucracy .but I be in favour of local authority use the range of their power and influence , and experiment , when traffic condition require it and when they be appropriate to local circumstance .they should be see to be make the choice and take the responsibility .
21942-1977-01-20.11.1.36.24-labour	decision should not be take from the top downward .solution should be base on the problem encounter by ordinary people , whether at work or in business , in the area where they live , where people be try to invest or to create more job .let the detail be examine , whatever those detail may be .look at problem in this way , one begin to discern the strand of a problem which have national application and on which national decision must be take .take together , all these local factor give a firm indication of national need .the problem with bureaucracy be that planning decision be take from the top downward instead of from the bottom upwards .I commend those thought to the Minister .
22170-1977-01-20.11.1.46.21-liberal	I can not advocate the idea of a national transport council — it will be another bureaucracy — but , with the likelihood of Scottish and Welsh Assemblies and possible regional authority in England , there be some sense in have elect regional transport executive to try to coordinate road and rail expenditure on a more sensible basis .
21743-1977-01-24.11.1.13.4-labour	I have be tell firmly by some regional authority that they be completely master in their own house and intend to remain so .this be a matter of management .some of we believe that duplication of bureaucracy be wasteful and expensive for consumer .minister have an obligation to make this point .some misplaced opposition come from those who intend — if they can — to maintain the policy of have 10 totally independent regional water authority .
21888-1977-01-24.11.1.76.4-conservative	thirdly , this seem to be a pave Bill for a yet further spread of bureaucracy .I be certain that if the Minister of State — who have be Minister responsible for sport , Minister responsible for water and Minister responsible for the drought , and be now champion of the leek himself in Wales — stay in office , we shall get a national water grid and all the paraphernalia of a high water tier , more civil servant employ , and the general confusion that so often spread not so much from a socialist approach but from a bureaucratic approach to a problem which can be perfectly well handle by individual water board concern .
19303-1977-01-24.11.1.92.9-liberal	I do not believe that we shall have a sensible water policy until we have a national water grid .I want all water supply to be nationalise .that need not lead to a tremendous bureaucracy .it can be rationalise and make subject to elect authority .that be another reason for have regional elect authority as part of a federal system of devolution .if it do not happen , the United Kingdom will break up .however , that be as irrelevant a point as one or two of the issue raise by the right hon .member for Bermondsey , so I feel that I be in good company .
10289-1977-01-24.12.1.86.1-conservative	the hon .Gentleman raise the case of someone who fall foul of the rule through no fault of his own .we immediately say that his case should go through .I recognise that when a vehicle be write off or the market be destroy there be a case for sensible interpretation of the rule .I be always prepared to look at a case to see whether we can find a practical solution to it .let we approach the matter in a spirit of common sense .we do not want too much bureaucracy .it be ridiculous to wrap these thing up in rule and regulation .let we be sensible and practical .
17691-1977-01-25.8.3.122.9-conservative	the point that I wish to make be the same point that I make at the beginning of my speech .it be that the weight of the bureaucracy which this proposal will impose be something that the people of Scotland do not want .what these amendment seek to do be to reduce that weight and greatly to reduce the cost .
19169-1977-01-25.8.3.143.5-conservative	another objection to the Bill be that it will create more bureaucracy .there be a very interesting report in the last edition of the Sunday Times that show that the Government have seriously underestimate the amount of bureaucracy that it will create .I see that the Minister be shake his head .perhaps he can answer the point .civil servant work for the British Aircraft Corporation have say that even if some of their authority be devolve to Scotland they would tolerate no cut in the number of civil servant work for BAC in England .that be one example of the way in which bureaucracy will be increase by the Bill .under the scheme that I propose , with Scottish Members sit in Edinburgh on suitable occasion , there would be no increase in government and bureaucracy .there would be only a marginal increase in cost result from the need to staff the place where the hon .member would meet .
19169-1977-01-25.8.3.143.10-conservative	the system which I have suggest , while create no more government , bureaucracy , expenditure , threat of create power of taxation or divisiveness , would give physical expression in Edinburgh to the feeling of scottish identity and , combine with a reform of the procedure of this House and the establishment of Select Committees or congressional - style committee , would enable we to give close scrutiny to the Government and the Civil Service .it would improve the quality of government without add an expensive , vast , lumber , devisive superstructure as the Bill seek to do .
16428-1977-01-25.8.3.161.3-conservative	first , I strongly support what be say by my hon .friend the Member for Fife , East ( Sir J. Gilmour ) about the number of the Scottish Assembly .I can not see why we require , because we be to have a Scottish Assembly , three people in each constituency to do the work currently do by one person .it do not make sense to I , it will add to bureaucracy and to expense , and it ought to be resist .
16428-1977-01-25.8.3.161.5-conservative	I beg the Government to look again at this matter , because it be this kind of increase bureaucracy and expense that make many people in Scotland who want more political control of scottish affair nervous about the consequence and result of have that .I hope that the Government will be forthcoming on that score .
16392-1977-01-27.4.1.11.1-labour	do my right hon .friend agree that we could more profitably advance democracy by spend this year abolish the House of Lords and reform the House of Commons than multiply bureaucracy in the form of devolution ?
22244-1977-01-27.10.1.3.19-conservative	the Government and local authority should give urgent consideration to the good mean of encourage the work of church and other voluntary organisation .many worker in such organisation complain of their frustration at local authority bureaucracy and at the delay in deal with their request .I would therefore ask the Home Secretary to inquire into these problem through the Voluntary Service Unit at the Home Office .I hope that this unit will be use and that effort will be make to investigate what be happen in the work of many local authority in deal with the voluntary organisation in other area .
18893-1977-01-27.10.1.9.3-labour	I shall look at the point that the right hon .Gentleman make about local authority bureaucracy .there be always lesson to be learn in politic , and whenever I be involve in policy that require structural change I never make the mistake of the last conservative Government in its reorganisation of local government in the early 1970 .that be the great disaster of all time , and I have the example write above my desk to make sure that I do not fall into a similar error .that aberration of the last Conservative Government cause the bureaucracy .
22558-1977-01-27.10.1.10.1-conservative	why do this Government do nothing about check that bureaucracy ?why do they take no account of the inquiry that be set up just before they come to power ?where have that inquiry 's report go ?
18893-1977-01-27.10.1.11.1-labour	I do not need a rubric on my desk to remind I of the local government disaster ; I shall keep a picture of the right hon .Gentleman .that disaster lead to the bureaucracy with which I have to cope .
18622-1977-01-28.4.1.32.3-conservative	I wish to refer to certain aspect of the measure and describe some of my personal minor misgiving .I do not emphasise these point for any want of admiration of the magnificent record of the insurance broke industry or of the independence and sound judgment of my hon .friend .as conservative , he and I must be more than usually sceptical about new legislation , however well - intentione , because our country be already over - burden by a massive excess of bureaucracy , rule , regulation and new law .whether these law be mandatory , permissive or self - regulatory , as be the Bill , we must still be sceptical , indeed critical , of the need for new law of any kind .
18853-1977-02-01.8.3.101.2-conservative	I follow with interest the argument advance by the right hon .member for Down , South ( Mr. Powell ) and the hon .Member for Bedwellty ( Mr. Kinnock ) on the pro and con of referenda and General Elections .however , I do not now propose to go into the subject of a referendum .I merely wish to make the point that we be talk about a different animal , and indeed a strange animal .it have be say that it be intend to take the bureaucracy near to the scottish people by create a new Scottish Executive .I look into the situation and I be intrigue to find that the Scottish Department now employ 8,000 civil servant in Scotland , and only 60 in London .it be propose to remove half the figure of 60 to Scotland and to provide a new Executive involve an extra 750 staff in Scotland .that will not take the bureaucracy near to Scotland because it be already there .all that will happen be that the Bill will add to that number .however , I shall not pursue that point .
16426-1977-02-01.8.3.258.1-labour	it could have be in Edinburgh .I should have like a position where we change from year to year and have our Parliament in different part of the United Kingdom .of course that would be difficult , because of the problem of transport the whole bureaucracy each time .however , it could have be do .but it be still a matter of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and not of Westminster .
16426-1977-02-01.8.3.260.1-labour	it be quite obvious that the growth of bureaucracy have go on throughout the age .I merely want to point out that I do not like the constant emotive use of the term .
18930-1977-02-04.4.1.3.14-conservative	other country have be ahead of we in try to prevent over - centralisation of control , which could so easily destroy our industrial democracy — which could so quickly , if we be not careful , become an industrial bureaucracy .with that kind of threat , surely this be not the time for the Government to oppose the Bill .
18930-1977-02-04.4.1.7.15-conservative	we must face the reality that 96 per cent .of those who vote at election do not , as individual , have any direct shareholding in industry .it be because I want to alter this balance that I be introduce the Bill .I do not want nationalisation or over - centralisation .I want real industrial democracy , not bureaucracy .this be the way to do it , and that be why I commend the Bill to the House .
17827-1977-02-04.4.1.9.17-conservative	there be no such large store of wealth and there have not be for many year past .but there be a considerable stock of asset control by the nationalise industry and by the State in the name of the people , and very large bureaucracy have grow up in the nationalise industry .I agree with the concept of the Labour Party , a fundamental shift of wealth from the rich to the poor , if , as I believe , that mean hand over the asset to the worker in the nationalise industry .at present there be very little return from some of our nationalise industry .
18267-1977-02-04.4.1.13.22-conservative	in the light of the Bill , we should consider the importance of the general extension of responsibility of ownership .institution be begin to take a great share of ownership and be begin to accept the need for director to represent their interest , overlook the working of management .as a result , in this country — more than in the rest of Europe and certainly more than in the United States — wealth be be own on behalf of people .it be be organise by other for they .there be mount bureaucracy within industry itself as well as in the Government .the result be the taking away of individual freedom and responsibility even though the bureaucracy may be do well and be honourably do its good .
16650-1977-02-04.4.1.81.11-labour	we have hear from the hon .member for Guildford ( Mr. Howell ) about the rôle of the State .from the Opposition Benches there be the chant that State oppression be synonymous with Socialism .it be nothing of the sort .that do not relate to genuine socialism .the growth of the State , the overweight of the State and the overweight of bureaucracy have nothing to do with socialist theory .in fact , socialist theory be all about the wither away of the State , the lessening of the State , the lessening of armed body of man .Engels , Marx 's collaborator , once describe the power of the State in the last analysis as be armed body of man and not bit of paper , not rule that we may lay down in the House from time to time .
18240-1977-02-07.7.1.83.5-labour	"""another important objective of european direct election be that these will mean that there will be great control over the activity of the Commission and ultimately the Council of Ministers .many hon .member who oppose our entry into the EEC complain repeatedly over the year that there be no democratic control over the Commission .they complain about these bureaucrat — although the bureaucracy in Europe be very tiny compare with our own — and say that there be no way of control they .we be now finally get to grip with the problem of democratic control , and this will spare many of my hon .friend from long weary hour in this Chamber and """" scorch earth """" tactic late at night when they be try to control european legislation .that burden will be take from they by directly - elect member who will have the time to deal with it ."""
10053-1977-02-07.7.1.87.1-conservative	we have be urge to be brief and , therefore , I shall make only one point .all along and for year the hon .member for Belper ( Mr. MacFarquhar ) have admit be a federalist , and we respect he for do so .I regret so much , however , that other in favour of direct election have shy away from that phrase .we know perfectly well that most , if not all , of they believe in some kind of United States of Europe , even a supranational institution with power that prevail over the subordinate national institution .in plain word , they would like a European Parliament to take over the power of this House .as the hon .member for Belper be good enough to recognise , it be only when that be do that , in their view , they will have sufficient power over the European Commission and its bureaucracy .
22067-1977-02-08.9.1.85.12-labour	in any urban society , one must concede part of an individual 's freedom in order to maintain civilised life .now a new balance have to be strike between the possible conflict of plutonium and the reality of human folly .effective vigilance be need to ensure that the loss of liberty be minimal and that the bureaucracy of security be unobstrusive .

22486-1977-02-09.12.1.5.1-conservative	I be glad to speak after my hon .friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury ( Mr. Ridley ) , who put forward a move and powerful case .it be clear from what he say that we be talk not only about the 714 tax certificate but about the whole attitude of the Government towards self - employment .it be understandable that the self - employ be suspicious that the Government be hostile to they and that the Government regard they as the awkward squad who do not fit in with socialist planning and who do not like conform and be force into a mould .these be people who prefer the small unit , people who do not like paper work and bureaucracy .indeed , they be the people in the community who like do their own thing and be their own boss .
10511-1977-02-09.12.1.30.5-labour	I have say before in this House that I do not think it would be a bad thing to avoid all this rigamarole of income tax inspector , social security inspector and other inspector who be part of the bureaucracy .we could avoid all that quite easily by make available , as they do in other country , the tax return submit by everyone .all application for any State benefit would be subject to similar treatment .everything would be open to the public .that would ensure that all the return be accurate , and it would be a self - regulate system .
16418-1977-02-09.12.1.40.3-conservative	let we continue with the saga , for it be one very revealing of the extent to which the bureaucracy be lead we into a situation that would have do credit to the great inventor of nonsense .I be sure that Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear would not have believe that this could go on .
16418-1977-02-09.12.1.42.3-conservative	one last point deserve to be make .on 21st January , the inspector of taxis write as follow : the Departmental Instructions concern — these be the word to which I draw your attention , Mr. Deputy Speaker — ( which be about 80 page long ) deal in detail with the security aspect of the new subcontractor ' scheme .… my head Office have confirm that these instruction be for Departmental use only and I be afraid that I can not send you a copy eighty page of departmental instruction ; 80 page design to add to the burden of those who be struggle to make a living in the construction industry ; 80 page that hon .member be tell they can not see , although we be send here to protect the people against the tyranny of the new bureaucracy .
22496-1977-02-09.12.1.59.14-conservative	my hon .friend the Member for Eastbourne ( Mr. Gow ) draw attention to the tyranny of the new bureaucracy and give the example of one of his constituent who be deny a certificate because he have grow a moustache .if I be to shave off a moustache , grow a beard , become bald , or go grey , I presume that I should be deny a certificate .
19169-1977-02-10.12.1.79.1-conservative	if the hon .Gentleman say that that statement be a fact and that be why it be include , why do he not also include statement of the fact that it will cost £ 36 million and will need another 1,000 civil servant to administer , with a general increase in bureaucracy ?
16418-1977-02-11.3.1.25.2-conservative	in the Bill , under my hon .friend 's very splendid proposal for relaxation , still we have the traffic commissioner .we must not be unkind to traffic commissioner , of course , I could almost become the founder president of a society for be kind to traffic commissioner .but we have to remember whose creature they be .traffic commissioner be appoint by the Secretary of State , by county council and by district council .it be not the fault of the traffic commissioner that they have to administer the licensing system .but , because they be the creature of the bureaucracy , they be not give to great innovation .let we take away from the Traffic Commissioners the power which the Bill confer upon they .it would be much well if the power my hon .friend seek to confer upon the traffic commissioner be confer on certain select Tory member .that would ensure that we have a more original and more dynamic approach to the granting of permit .
21906-1977-02-11.3.1.37.8-conservative	I receive a letter this week from a constituent say that she have difficulty get her child to school and that other resident in the area have the same difficulty .apparently there be a municipal bus which come so far and no far because some other municipal road transport concession have be give to another bus company .a private bus can not pick up her friend and relation because of the restriction on its licence .there be another transport restriction for another school bus which do not allow it to pick up child from another area .therefore , although there be a number of bus with empty seat go to and from this fringe part of the town into the centre where the school be , nothing can be do .that be pure red tape .it be bureaucracy go mad .
14158-1977-02-15.11.1.206.7-labour	the recognition that there have be no mandate from the electorate mean that the time be ripe for the Government to consider whether they wish to obtain a mandate .I be sure that I be interpret correctly the view of the overwhelming majority of member of the Parliamentary Labour Party and Opposition Members when I say that what they all desire be that the people of Wales and Scotland should reject the proposal if we have the referendum .that be not a view hold simply by my hon .friend the Member for Liverpool , Walton ( Mr. Heffer ) , who have put forward his view as vigorously as we expect he to .it be the general view of all except my right hon .friend the Leader of the House and the Secretary of State for Wales , and a handful of other .I challenge my right hon .friend the Leader of the House to ask the Parliamentary Labour Party whether it want the Government to campaign in the propose referendum .do it want the Government to give the people of Wales and Scotland a choice , or do it want to persuade they that the good thing for the United Kingdom be that we should have this muddle devolution Bill ?the Government have no mandate from the Parliamentary Labour Party to campaign for these devolution proposal .what they will do by the clause be to meet the wish of the Committee and the Parliamentary Labour Party that the people of Wales should have the choice .but nothing would be more absurd than that we should put through a Bill and then , by a campaign , try to create what the Government could call a form of compulsory democracy and what I would describe as compulsory bureaucracy .I believe that the overwhelming majority of hon .member do not wish to see the Bill come into effect , but they feel that they have no alternative to let the people of Wales and Scotland decide for themselves .
17211-1977-02-15.11.1.242.2-labour	I be not unalterably opposed to the Bill if that be what the elector of Scotland and Wales want , but propose it be a serious mistake .at good , the consequence of the Bill will be to complicate Government , delay Government , add to the cost of government in the region , add to bureaucracy and add to the problem of try to pass any measure or achieve any change .that be the good result that we can hope for .the bad result have be outline by the hon .member for Argyll ( Mr. MacCormick ) .
18498-1977-02-15.11.1.259.5-labour	I be not against the principle of a referendum as such .it be a legitimate device to assess Government policy and genuinely widen the basis of consultation and consent between the Government and the electorate .but that be one reason that I be against the Bill — that , far from achieve any of its objective , it propose another layer of bureaucracy in Scotland and Wales , while deny England any say in the future of Britain as a whole .
19464-1977-02-17.14.1.66.5-labour	I wish to make one point in favour of bureaucracy .a jobcentre be open in the Lydney area of my constituency and as a result there be an initial increase of 40 per cent .in the number of people find job .that have now settle down at an increase of 20 per cent .above the previous level .I therefore urge my right hon .friend to study the beneficial effect of the jobcentre , because in area such as our those benefit can be enormous .
18622-1977-02-21.10.1.44.2-conservative	"""despite the criticism make of that unit , I should add that I hear many good word say about it , about its skill and its professionalism , and I be glad that we shall be retain a unit at our disposal .I must add that I should not expect the unit to remain after July the same size as it be now .it would be only too typical of our bureaucracy if , when responsibility for these matter move to Brussels in July , instead of diminish it increase in size in order to give well advice to Brussels .let we be clear that when our position be reverse the first question which I shall wish to ask be """" what be the size of the unit before the transfer of responsibility to Brussels , compare with the size after transfer ? """"I hope that the bureaucracy be forewarn of an impending , not unreasonable , question on that subject ."""
21973-1977-02-21.10.1.68.16-conservative	it be all too easy to lapse — and we on this side lapse perhaps rather too easily — into the use of free trade as a concept .I do not believe that free trade ever exist or ever will exist .it be a nice , useful catch - phrase which usually disguise the fact that in any market of the world , if one look at the range of commodity import , one will find that there be restriction .there be license and surveillance arrangement , quota , administrative difficulty and enormous bureaucracy .there be also difficulty at consular level in diplomatic term .
22543-1977-02-21.10.1.72.13-labour	finally , I turn to the question of surveillance procedure , which I consider to be one of the most important part of any Multifibre Arrangement or any antidumping agreement .I hope that I may have the attention of the hon .Member for St. Ives .I be not convince that our present surveillance procedure for examine whether good be be dump be as effective as they could or should be .it may be that there be not enough people engage on surveillance work .the hon .Member for St. Ives say that he would like a reduction in bureaucracy in this country when much of the responsibility for these matter be transfer to the EEC in July .I do not know about that — I have an open mind on the subject — but I think that the present system be not effective enough .
14158-1977-02-22.11.1.179.9-labour	as the debate proceed in Wales , the implication be understand and there be an increase clamour for more consideration to be give to all these individual right .far beyond the sectional interest , there will be no time under a guillotine to deal with those matter about which Wales be so anxious .the Welsh language be an important subject but be it believe that there will be time to discuss amendment design to provide that there will be no unfair action bar people in Wales who do not speak Welsh from promotion or reach the elite of the new bureaucracy that be to be establish ?
18853-1977-02-22.11.1.195.8-conservative	there be many argument that one could make — bureaucracy , the failure to have one Bill for Scotland and another for Wales , and whether the Bill be really want .my view be that we should defeat the guillotine with a view to defeat the Bill .
18853-1977-02-22.11.1.195.17-conservative	there be other more serious point .I believe that this Parliament could with great benefit sit in Edinburgh a couple of time every year .if we be to broadcast our proceeding on television as well as on radio , that would show that Parliament be not such a remote body as be sometimes argue .the power of television be capable of bring the Government close in reality to people in their home than by pick up part of the apparatus of Government and plonk it down in Edinburgh .however , I can not refrain from say that the bureaucracy be in Edinburgh already .there be only 60 Scottish Office civil servant in London .
22141-1977-02-22.11.1.207.20-conservative	this measure , which be suppose in the cause of democracy to control bureaucracy , will remain as draft by the bureaucrat , largely unamended , by the democratic House of Commons .in a way , that be almost the final irony .from now on , if the House find something to dwell upon , it will do so at the expense of leave much else unconsidered .be there any reason to think that the Government , in the course of the debate on the 112 remain clause , will be force to make few change than during the passage of the first four , where they have perform a series of somersault ?
21990-1977-02-23.16.1.17.8-conservative	what be to be do ?several possible solution have be offer .Most of they be complementary , and some have emanate from the other place .a write constitution be one possibility , but , with all its merit , it bring some problem in its train and could lead to a vast increase in governmental bureaucracy and interference by legal intervention , as we see in America and France .a new Bill of Rights be another possibility .but the preparation of such a Bill and adherence to it must require more political consensus than exist between the party battle line today .
10565-1977-02-24.6.11.6.1-conservative	be the hon .gentleman aware of the degree of resentment feel by widow and other in the low - income bracket in area such as Liverpool and other large city ?be he aware how perplexed they be when they go into the tax net for the first time ?have he any idea of the cost of bureaucracy in administer all these tax benefit ?
10158-1977-02-24.6.11.7.1-labour	I must tell the hon .gentleman that it have nothing to do with bureaucracy .I accept that widow feel aggrieve , because very often they go into the tax net at low level of income .we all accept that .many people be affect , include single person other than widow .in the main , this be a difficulty create by inflation .
10152-1977-02-24.11.1.4.1-labour	on a point of order , Mr. Murton .I do not challenge your selection of amendment , but may I draw your attention to page 2008 of the Amendment Paper and Amendment ( zz ) to the new schedule — referendum in Scotland and Wales — in line 86 , after ' Scotland ' , insert in the full knowledge that not a penny of the North Sea oil revenue will be earmark for the Assembly , and that because the English Regions will insist that a Scotland , with an Edinburgh Assembly , will get no more than its share per head of the United Kingdom cake , relatively less resource will be available to Scotland than at the present time , when successive british government have recognise Scotland 's special need for public money .' ( 2 ) at a time when the Prime Minister rightly give top priority to the need of manufacturing and productive industry , do you want yet another layer of non - productive bureaucracy and government , add not a penny to the real wealth of the country ?' ( 3 ) at a time when Great Britain do not have enough money to employ all the teacher we have train , when we be desperately short of nursery school provision , when Dunfermline College of Education for Women PE Teachers , Callendar Park and Craigie Colleges of Education be threaten with closure , when the Cardinal Archbishop of Edinburgh and St. Andrew 's preache from his pulpit against the closure of Craiglockhart Colleges for train catholic teacher , when it be impossible to maintain let alone improve hospital service and provision for the mentally ill , when the ratepayer and taxpayer be angry than ever before about the difficulty of make end meet , when housing start be far too low to provide for young married couple in the future , do you as a priority want yet again an enormously costly shake - up in the form of Government ?
10152-1977-02-24.12.3.135.1-labour	finally , as I see that my hon .friend the Member for Glasgow , Queens Park ( Mr. McElhone ) be here , I can not resist in the present circumstance talk to he about one issue that I would like to see in the referendum .at a time when we be short of finance for the very seed corn of the training college , do we want to take away job in teacher training and create yet another bureaucracy ?
22552-1977-02-25.4.1.38.4-labour	the charitable clinic and nursing home be set up because of this attitude of the reactionary chauvinist doctor to whom I have refer .those who deny relief be the very one who drive woman into the private sector .yet it be the highly responsible skilled and efficient private sector , namely the charitable clinic and advisory bureaux , that this Bill seek to smother in a welter of crazy bureaucracy , involve umpteen inspector , police and other to administer its provision .that be rather extraordinary from a representative of the Conservative Party , most of whose member complain about the level of public expenditure .this Bill will certainly add to that level of expenditure .
19526-1977-02-25.4.1.68.9-labour	I now want to turn to the recommendation that we make .it be rarely recognise — although it ought to be — that the unique feature of our abortion law be that the evidence of two register medical practitioner be require before an abortion can take place .I be all in favour of that .one have only to think of the condition of pregnant woman to realise how distressing it be for they in other country to have to go through the official machinery and to face bureaucracy in seek abortion .but I emphasise that two register practitioner , not one , be require under the 1967 Act .
16393-1977-02-25.4.1.119.6-conservative	the Bill offend many of the principle in which I believe .it will increase bureaucracy and state interference in private life .it will frustrate the intend medical benefit and make it more diffi- cult for a girl to get an abortion quickly .the Bill pretend that it do not want abortion to be carry out at a later stage than they be at present , but it make it inevitable that abortion will be do later or not at all .
21902-1977-02-28.28.1.61.16-conservative	the juggling might be justifiable if the money be to be use to a great effect to reduce unemployment , but that be open to question .its first use will be to create a bureaucracy .we have a Government of political opportunist , desperately anxious for some whiff of political kudo as a result of their economic machination , and yet they fail .they fail themselves and the country .
22170-1977-03-03.10.1.3.1-liberal	I be pleased to hear the Minister 's response to my question .do he accept that there be too much bureaucracy and secrecy in the administration of the Prison Service and that there be a great need for well public relation between the Prison Service and the general public ?do he agree that there be a dire need for the Home Office to give an early official response when incident occur rather than , as at present , the Home Office attitude lead to outside body publish document that be often misleading ?
16780-1977-03-03.20.1.14.1-labour	be the Secretary of State aware that his announcement about the extension of these scheme will be welcome in Scotland ?be he aware that a number of they have be well administered and that they be effective both for the young people concern and for the community as a whole ?may we have an assurance that in the review by the Manpower Services Commission the factor of success , which be often the result of the quality of the organiser , will not be overweighte by top - heavy bureaucracy ?
17853-1977-03-03.32.1.3.4-conservative	More and more people see that they get less money in work than they do out of work , and this be have a deeply damaging effect on the willingness of people to work , to acquire skill and to take risk , not just discourage they , but drive they away from this country .all this be cause the growth of a more and more complex and expensive bureaucracy in the Inland Revenue .the House will have see the growth of that service — an increase of 6,000 last year to a figure of 80,000 — report in the paper today .the number be now probably up to as much as 85,000 .
21726-1977-03-03.32.1.129.3-conservative	I do not agree with the fashionable idea that be currently go the round for reorganise the Treasury by split it .that to I would add confusion and bureaucracy to the current situation .I would offer what might be the good answer — and this be a subject upon which a number of my hon .friend , include my hon .friend the Member for Horsham and Crawley ( Mr. Hordern ) , have touch this afternoon — of give a more permanent responsibility to a Committee of this House to safeguard the individual and oversee the operation of the tax Departments .there may be something there .the good hope for safeguard our freedom be the revival of the power and authority of Parliament .
22227-1977-03-04.4.1.100.5-conservative	I do not think that the hon .member for Blyth have the support of the Labour Party in this measure , although he may get a few people to pay lip service to it .there be no incentive in nationalise industry .nationalisation be merely the inflexible hand of socialism create bureaucracy .People in this country have suffer for too long with bureaucracy .it be essential that there should be a profit motive .
22227-1977-03-04.4.1.104.3-conservative	the Bill provide that the Government should be a second source of revenue .but why do we need all this paraphernalia ?if the Government want to do something , let they do it through the local authority .why set up this paraphernalia to upset the building society and the exist structure , impose the dead hand of bureaucracy ?a nationalise set - up would not prosper .
19004-1977-03-04.4.1.140.10-conservative	the Bill propose yet another corporation .the British Building Societies Corporation — it sound like a nasty amalgam of the BBC and the British Steel Corporation .the Bill would give it very extensive power , and the Secretary of State would also be give further massive power .in Clause 10 we find that a vest order shall specify the date ( in this Act refer to as the ` transfer date ' ) on which a building society be to vest in the Corporation and shall make all such provision as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient for or in connection with the vesting of the building society in the Corporation and matter arise thereout .that mean that the Secretary of State be totally in control .he can do almost anything on a vest order , include the declaration of capital punishment for the manage director and the depositor .inevitably this must mean more bureaucracy .
19004-1977-03-04.4.1.140.14-conservative	I do not think that nationalisation either improve property management or contribute to improve efficiency in any other aspect of business .inevitably there would be the overlap bureaucracy — committee supervise other committee and so on .
21717-1977-03-08.7.1.2.1-liberal_democrats	I beg to move , that leave be give to bring in a Bill to provide protection for the vendor of real property when place their property in the hand of estate agent , particularly , but not exclusively , those agent who advertise on a no - sale , no - fee basis .I wish to make two comment at the outset of my remark .this Bill be introduce as a consequence of the experience of one of my constituent .I wish to make it clear that I do not believe that every estate agent be a disreputable shark .as in every area of activity in life , there be disreputable people and there be smart - alec estate agent .however , no reputable estate agent who act honestly and fairly have anything to fear from my Bill .I take the view that the House should seek to defend individual against dictatorial bureaucracy and should also defend consumer against the clever smart - alec who be out to earn quick money at the expense of other .
18389-1977-03-08.18.1.24.3-labour	one thing that we want to correct in local authority planning — this bear out the cogent point make by my hon .friend the Member for Maryhill — be to save time and unnecessary bureaucracy .all hon .member who have be involve in the difficulty that Glasgow have in plan new comprehensive development area , such as the hon .member for Cathcart , will know that there be a great need to simplify planning procedure .strangely enough , I have always accept that there be a degree of common sense and logic in most of the argument put forward by the hon .member for Ayr , although his effort last night be unworthy of his high standard — but we all have our weakness .he would be the first to accept that if the Secretary of State have flexibility of control , and if we can in some way help the local authority and prevent they from incur more expenditure and use a great deal of time and precious labour , we should do so .
18389-1977-03-08.18.1.41.2-labour	I have already say that planning should be deal with expeditiously and with as little bureaucracy as possible .this attempt by the hon .member continually to intervene and to continue with this time - waste exercise be disrupt the progress of our legislation .he have be do it in a very unconstructive way , as be so typical of he .
22533-1977-03-09.9.3.28.2-labour	it be as important to reduce the competition for job amongst the old as it be to provide for job release .additionally there would be a great deal of unfairness if the unemployed be exclude from the scheme because for many it would be a lottery whether they be entitle to the job release allowance .it would be a lottery whether redundancy be declare at one point of time or another .we would have to have a bureaucracy which we do not want in operating way in which employment could be arrange and job release arrange , with the unemployed move into job only subsequently to leave they in order to get job release term .there be substantial practical difficulty in distinguish between they , but I do not want to rest my case on that .I rest it basically on three point .
22215-1977-03-10.8.3.30.7-ulster_unionist_party	I hope that the Minister 's steering committee may be able to do something to tackle the deficiency that obviously exist in the present set - up .security present a problem for the Housing Executive in Belfast but I be not prepared for it to become the scapegoat to cover the present lack of performance .the steering committee , chair by the Minister , might be able to do something , but I be pessimistic , because the committee seem to be compose of the same old face , the same people who have fail abysmally in the past few year to get anything do .I be afraid that the new committee will be merely another cog in the wheel of bureaucracy , another committee to report , another time - consume body , another mini - Housing Executive .I ask the Minister to chew the matter over to see whether he can make it a more convincing and credible body .

21906-1977-05-17.12.2.43.2-conservative	the third change be that we have , I think , learn a little in the 12 year or so since the passing of this legislation , and we realise that if we can make saving in bureaucracy and in public expenditure , that will be to the good of the nation .the Government have be make very strenuous effort to cut back on public expenditure and to cut out waste , particularly bureaucratic waste .here be an opportunity to do this and to remove a useless layer upon the bureaucratic system .it be an opportunity of which I should have think that the Government , in the present financial strait , would have be only too delighted to take advantage .
21906-1977-05-17.12.2.43.4-conservative	in short , therefore , I say that this sort of legislation proliferate a wholly unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and planning control .office development should well be leave to those who know good about it — namely , the regional planning authority or other form of local planning authority .when the present legislation expire on 4th August it should be allow to stay expire .it have serve its purpose and it should go .I be pleased that the Opposition have take a hard line against it .
18007-1977-05-17.12.2.49.2-united_kingdom_independence_party	the hon .Gentleman make his normal , expect protestation about bureaucracy and free enterprise .that be what we have learn to expect from he .what he say be what we have hear so often from the Opposition Benches .conservative want a Tory free - for - all .they want no attempt to determine a proper , logical , coherent plan of development that will suit the country as a whole and the region in it — region such as Merseyside and the North - East , which have suffer year of neglect and decline .if tory freedom , Tory free - for - all and the loosening of control and bureaucracy that the hon .Gentleman want be allow to take place , they will lead to the proliferation of office building in London that be build at a profit , build to stay empty , while we have dereliction , high housing cost , a lack of adequate housing , and many other deficiency .
18007-1977-05-17.12.2.51.9-united_kingdom_independence_party	we hear the Conservatives talk about freedom from control and call for public expenditure cut in other area .they want freedom from bureaucracy and yet they complain about unemployment in the North - West and Merseyside .they complain also about direct work department .I know of no direct work department that have build a block of office that have remain empty .no such department have build a Centre Point that have remain empty for year .if there be to be control of office development , it should not just be the control in the Bill that ensure that office move out to area where they be need , but a control to ensure that far more of our capital resource be put into the building of home .
22558-1977-05-17.12.2.60.23-conservative	my hon .friend the Member for Manchester , Withington ( Mr. Silvester ) say that if odp be to go , something should be put in their place .my hon Friend want to destroy the ODP system , as I do , but I do not want to destroy the whole of planning control .I wish to see provide a far well form of control — one within the normal planning law in partnership with the local authority .the normal planning law would be apply and the Secretary of State could call in whatever he feel be of national or regional importance .that would mean that we should do away with the bureaucracy of the present ODP system and recognise that a planning system can deal with the problem that confront we far more effectively .
22051-1977-05-17.12.2.62.4-labour	I be mildly surprised by the number of Opposition Members who raise the bureaucracy bogy .they admit that only 14 staff in the Department cope with ODP control and that the Location of Offices Bureau spend less than £ 250,000 a year , yet we hear about bureaucratic control and the Government be reluctant to surrender this form of control .hon .member seem to be see if not Communists at least bureaucrat under the bed .
19096-1977-05-18.7.1.36.9-labour	I be pleased about the approach of my right hon .friend the Foreign Secretary to this problem .we can do a great deal in Helsinki provide that we do not expect too much too soon .representation can be make without public denunciation even by a Government , provide that they do it in the correct way .some of the decision that be take in the Soviet Union and with which many of we be concern be not politically , centrally decide .they be decide by the bureaucracy of that country .
19169-1977-05-18.7.1.40.16-conservative	I do not want to pose as a great expert on how the Soviet Union work , but my experience of soviet bureaucracy be that , even when it want to try to move fast , it can only move slowly because it be the most cumbersome bureaucratic machine I have ever come across , however marginal and on the surface my experience be .we should not expect it to move with the same amazing rapidity as we sometimes see — perhaps not very often — in our own Civil Service and Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary .
22251-1977-05-19.11.1.14.11-conservative	there be bind to be concern that at the recent meeting in Brussels the rider have to be insert that for some individual country economic circumstance will affect what can be achieve .this be a direct reference to the 3 per cent .target of increase .the suggestion be that this rider be insert at the request of our own Secretary of State .I hope that that be not so .with our defence expenditure per head less than half of that the United States and one - third less than that of West Germany , I hope that the Minister will not seek to plead that resource can not be find for Britain to pay her fair share .that be unacceptable for a government who squander resource on a vastly increase bureaucracy and utterly irrelevant nationalisation cost the taxpayer billion of pound and for a government who be devote £ 275 million a year to the National Enterprise Board , which must now be regard in an even more dubious light than before .for such a Government to argue that resource can not be find to do what be necessary for the Army , Navy and Air Force be unacceptable .
16418-1977-05-20.5.3.2.4-conservative	what be remarkable be that this tendency to prolixity , which be sometimes the vice of lawyer , be a continue vice of successive government .the bureaucracy of the Civil Service rejoice in use 10 word if one will serve the purpose equally well .however — and this be why this morning be such a memorable occasion — the Under - Secretary of State for Transport have indicate to my hon .friend and to myself that the Government favour this change in the Bill or , if that be go too far , at least will not object to it .therefore , we ought to pay tribute this morning to the Undersecretary of State .in a Committee upstairs I describe he as one of the rise star of an otherwise really bad Government , and I repeat that tribute this morning .
10134-1977-05-20.7.1.3.21-conservative	no one should reflect with more chagrin than a Minister who have the misfortune to have an office in perhaps the ugly building within sight of the Palace of Westminster .it be a supreme irony that the Department of the Environment , create to protect the quality of life , be house in the most insensitive of all the temple of bureaucracy .I doubt whether the Minister would shed a tear if it be suddenly suggest that he should move into one of the nobler building in Whitehall .
22244-1977-05-23.11.1.11.3-conservative	there be also certain aspect of the report concern the independence of the authority in their relationship with the public which conveniently fall to be deal with in this part of my speech .I be greatly relieve — as I note , I think , be the Home Secretary — that the Committee have not propose some overall broadcasting council , which would have mean inevitably more bureaucracy and more cost , for no obvious reason .I believe , as I shall make clear throughout my speech , in the maintenance of the exist authority .I believe also that the Annan Committee 's view that the IBA 's control of the company have over the year work fairly and satisfactorily be right .therefore , I would personally prefer to keep this position .
22244-1977-05-23.11.1.11.4-conservative	rather in the same way , I can not support the suggestion — and I think that the Home Secretary be of the same mind — for a Public Enquiry Board .once again , there would be more bureaucracy and cost , just at a time when at any rate most people be seek mean of sensibly reduce public spending .indeed , the Committee itself appear to I somewhat to undermine its own proposal by its strong advocacy — with which I agree — of more public hearing in different part of the country by the exist broadcasting authority .such hearing would give the viewer the chance to express their idea and their feeling direct to the broadcaster , and so to the authority .I would only hope that if such hearing take place they will be well attend , and that the many people who complain to we , as their member of Parliament , and widely in other field , will take the opportunity of attend the hearing and put their particular proposal and idea to those who be responsible for the actual broadcasting .
22244-1977-05-23.11.1.11.7-conservative	on the other hand , my opposition to new body do not extend to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission , cover both authority , that the Committee propose .I think that this very modest — I trust — extension of bureaucracy would be widely welcome by the view public as give they a thoroughly reasonable right .
22244-1977-05-23.11.1.11.12-conservative	I turn to the particular recommendation that have attract most discussion and controversy .first there be the proposal to give the fourth television channel to a new body , the Open Broadcasting Authority .despite my basic dislike of new body , which lead to more bureaucracy and cost , I certainly appreciate the Committee 's purpose .it want to ensure , as I understand it , that when a fourth channel be introduce it would provide programme of different sort , that minority interest would be cater for , and that independent producer would have great opportunity .the thinking behind the proposal for the Open Broadcasting Authority be , therefore , both original and imaginative .
22244-1977-05-23.11.1.19.4-conservative	then there be the future of local radio .again , for reason of bureaucracy and cost , I would not favour the proposal to set up a new authority , nor can I see why it should be necessary .as the IBA be at present constitute , it be perfectly capable of control local radio , and this be recognise by the Committee .no one should imagine that this new authority could simply be establish by hive off the local radio division of the IBA .that be fly in the face of all experience of set up new authority or new body in any sphere of national life .we all know quite a lot about that subject , and we all have experience which we would be unwise to forget .
22127-1977-05-23.11.1.27.1-conservative	in the Middle Ages the Church be against the print press because it think that it would enable the masse to acquire learning .so , too , Parliament and some government have be obsess with the control of this comparatively new medium of broadcasting , radio and television .I take some pride in the fact that it be the Conservative Party which have widen the choice in both and which would do so yet again .I support the robust common sense express by my right hon .friend the Member for Penrith and the Border ( Mr. Whitelaw ) and I add my voice to those who have already reject a third authority .as we see it , the Open Broadcasting Authority that Annan suggest be yet another costly bureaucracy .I believe that ITV 2 would be complementary to ITV 1 and would provide ample opportunity for anything that be worth see on television that be not now see .the Annan type Open Broadcasting Authority would have to compete to survive , so by definition it could not succeed in Annan 's aim of make it a complementary service .
10436-1977-05-23.11.1.31.5-labour	I wish to say a few word on the BBC 's regional structure .one can agree with all the Annan criticism of the BBC bureaucracy , because the BBC 's problem be mainly problem of scale and bureaucracy .surely the answer to bureaucracy and centralisation be not to cut off local root in the form of the island site that the BBC have be try to develop to compete with commercial television .the answer be to encourage the BBC to expand its regional production and to integrate its regional production with its network production centre in the region and to provide commercial television with competition similar to that which commercial radio provide to BBC local radio — competition for the benefit of both .
16896-1977-05-23.11.1.42.4-conservative	I do not believe that there be a need for the various new authority recommend by Annan .I fear that inevitably they would lead to a general increase in bureaucracy .let I take as an example the Public Enquiry Board .I be glad to hear the Home Secretary pour cold water on that suggestion .despite what be say by the hon .member for Basildon ( Mr. Moonman ) , I regard such a board as a totally unnecessary concept .of course the BBC and the IBA must be see to be more responsible to the public , but surely the way to achieve that lie not in set up a new board but in allow the present organisation to work more effectively .the governor of the BBC be trustee of the public interest .the IBA be in many way in a similar capacity in regard to television .therefore , rather than that we should set up a new board , I hope that those body will respond by become more responsive to what be be say .
22082-1977-05-23.11.1.48.5-labour	there be also disquiet about the way in which many decision about how television and radio should develop have be handle .that be why we want an amalgamated and independent complaint council .it would be a saving on bureaucracy and not an addition to it and most hon .member have welcome the suggestion .it would not be a tribunal of taste , but a real mean of redress in case of malpractise .that be why we want a Public Enquiry Board for broadcasting to look at the performance of the authority .various member have belittle this aspect of the report and ask why we should pull up the root , but this be precisely the argument advance against a setting up of the Annan Committee and the right hon .Member for Penrith and the Border ( Mr. Whitelaw ) have admit that he be mistaken in his original view and that he now welcome the establishment of the Committee .
22082-1977-05-23.11.1.48.7-labour	that be the case for a Public Enquiry Board that could involve the public through public hearing rather than through question by hon .member that be fob off by Ministers as they must do .the establishment of such a board be the way to enable the public to have its say in confrontation with those who have the exercise of power of broadcaster or broadcast authority responsible to Parliament .this body would be small and would have a trigger mechanism that would mean that any inquiry carry out beyond those into the performance of the authority , would have to be ask for by the Secretary of State .they would not come about as a result of a greedy bureaucracy seek , in some over - wean manner , to extend its remit .
22082-1977-05-23.11.1.48.12-labour	the BBC have be say that it be not in financial difficulty and that it be even expand its service in local radio , but we shall soon hear the rattle of the beg bowl when the Corporation come to the House ask for the licence fee to be raise .the Committee take the view that some service be beyond what it be reasonable to expect the licence fee to pay for .some of we want to go far .we make a case for separate BBC radio and television and a minority of six have this recommendation write into the main body of the report .our case be that these service , which be largely separate in practice , could develop in their own way without the desperate attempt to fit everything into a common BBC mould , which now occupy much of the time of that otiose bureaucracy that have already be attack in the debate .
22082-1977-05-23.11.1.48.13-labour	there be two way in which to deal with this .one be to federate , to turn it into an imitation ITV .but if one accept the BBC as a national instrument of broadcasting and that it have a centralised planning structure and that many advantage flow from that , the only real practical change be to separate radio and television and have two separate service run as two separate public corporation build out from under the kind of bureaucracy that lie across they both , attempt to co - ordinate and hold they together .that be what the minority of the Committee want .
17464-1977-05-23.11.1.64.9-liberal	there be the argument concern local radio and the new Authority to be set up to administer the iba and local BBC company .the Annan Report say that local radio be in a mess , and that be a pretty fair remark to make .I be not sure that it mean that local radio be in a mess in the way in which the Government Front Bench or the Liberal Party be in a mess .it mean simply that local radio be in a mess because the small independent company have to pay far too much towards support the bureaucracy of the IBA and that in the unlikely event of their make any extra money they would have to pay a secondary rental from that money .
17464-1977-05-23.11.1.66.7-liberal	on the subject of authority , it be quite right that someone , somewhere , should be responsible for everything that go out to the public , but we do already have two authority that work pretty well .surely the idea should be to make those authority work well rather than create yet more authority which will be even more expensive , which will give manifestation of even great patronage and simply create another tier of bureaucracy .
18293-1977-05-23.11.1.96.6-labour	there be part of the report that do not make specific proposal but should nevertheless be take seriously .the part under this heading that deserve special consideration be the criticism of the bureaucracy of the BBC .there be quite a lot of criticism of the BBC for be overstaffed , top heavily bureaucratic , excessively rigid , and so on .I have do work for the BBC over many year , and I be involve in make a series of programme for they now .although I be not express any personal complaint — and some of my colleague at the BBC will be angry at I for say it — almost everyone who work with or for the BBC be force to the conclusion that such criticism as the report be be true .it be an excessively bureaucratic organisation .it be top heavily staff .it do react either badly or complacently to criticism .
18293-1977-05-23.11.1.96.8-labour	a way must be find from outside — if it do not come from inside — of make the BBC cut the bureaucracy and overman , without pose any threat to programme .I be sure it can be do .it be one of the most important responsibility of the Home Secretary , who have the ultimate responsibility for the arrangement arrive at through the drafting of legislation .but I should still like to see the BBC do as much as it can to forestall action from outside because , as I say early , I do not welcome interference with broadcasting by politician .
17067-1977-05-23.11.1.104.4-labour	in one sense , it be important to answer the question pose by my hon .friend the Member for Leyton when he speak about how we should cut the size of the bureaucracy , because if one just close the tap sufficiently on the matter of the licence fee , the authority will have to sort it out themselves .
21990-1977-05-23.11.1.108.4-conservative	secondly , I believe that licence fee increase should be contain .the BBC must look for economy , and in look it might come to the conclusion that it should divest itself of local radio — not to eliminate those station that be so well established but purely as an economy measure .I believe that reduction in the bureaucracy be possible .an hon .member who work for the BBC confirm that early .I wonder what other economy there might be .
17464-1977-05-24.10.1.12.1-liberal	will the Minister accept that my own constituent , who be give a promise through I by his right hon .friend that he would level with they about any further discussion about pig farmer , will be extremely disappointed by his statement ?will he say whether there be other faction in the british industry that he be prepared to sell out for the sake of EEC bureaucracy ?
22529-1977-05-24.17.1.9.6-conservative	the truth be that the bureaucracy that the Government have impose on small business have frighten a great many small business man from take on labour and , in many case , from continue in business .we require a much great incentive , much more help and much less bureaucracy for small business .if the Secretary of State will only say today that in future he will exclude small business from the collection of statistic and the many other burden that have be push upon they recently he will do more to help employment than by any other measure he be likely to mention this afternoon .
10152-1977-05-24.17.1.10.1-labour	the right hon .gentleman talk about give tax incentive for skill .that be a seductive idea , but have he put it to the Inland Revenue Staff Federation ?I recollect that the right hon .member for Lowestoft ( Mr.prior ) be the Opposition spokesman who have for ever be complain about the amount of skilled manpower that go into tax collection and bureaucracy .be this not precisely the kind of idea that may be worth while at one level but may increase bureaucracy ?
10565-1977-05-24.17.1.63.1-conservative	I be grateful for that comment , because the Community Industry Scheme be start by a Conservative Government , who see the importance of involve young people at an early stage , whereas the succeed scheme have be full of bureaucracy and have be run by civil servant .
10565-1977-05-24.17.1.67.9-conservative	the main plank of the Holland Report be that by bring all these scheme under one grand , co - ordinating ideal all the problem will go .we must be very careful that merely by bring all the scheme into a central pool we do not develop even more bureaucracy than we have now .however many job the Government think they can artificially create and however many course they decide to run , there will always remain a sizeable number of youngster who prefer to do nothing and to draw their benefit .surely it be about time the Government pay some attention to they and give they opportunity to earn their living alongside everyone else .
17345-1977-05-24.17.1.81.3-conservative	we need such a wind of change through our centralised bureaucracy to get people back to work , to set the people free and to give employment .that can not be do by any Government agency .if the Government really want to reduce unemployment , they should act in the way that I have mention .this be a test between socialist dogma and job creation .
10647-1977-05-24.17.1.111.9-conservative	to solve this grow problem of youth unemployment , a national youth service could play a valuable part .I shall explain how I see the establishment of such a service .if the number of unemployed school leaver be to fall we must acknowledge some fundamental home truth .part of the problem stem from the Government assumption that their role be to act as a continue overlord provider , dish out social security benefit indefinitely .we all agree that that undermine the work ethic and rob young people of their independence and their sense of initiative .eventually they will resent the bureaucracy which control their life .instead of receive pocket money from their parent , they will receive it from the State .
10565-1977-05-26.15.2.45.2-conservative	even if my colleague be not here , include the hon .member in whose constituency Speke Airport be situate , the hon .member for Liverpool , Garston ( Mr. Loyden ) , I be glad of the opportunity to air the important subject of Liverpool 's airport .as the Minister well know — because he courteously correspond with I at great length over a long period , and have see , with I , representative of the chamber of commerce , and other interested party — the airport provide an essential outlet for industrialist on Merseyside .they tell I that they prefer it to Manchester , because they receive a quick and more personal service .the cargo section be efficiently run , with a minimum of bureaucracy .Size bring with it bureaucracy and delay .the small , personal concern of Speke , run as a family business would be run , give industrialist on Merseyside a great service .
16780-1977-06-13.10.1.65.2-labour	to continue to be practical , I hope not only in a technical sense but also in a political sense , I suggest that we should be realistic about some of the resistance to the establishment of the common fund .when I be in Washington I hear quite explicitly from official of AID , the department responsible for overseas aid in the United States , that a powerful argument against the idea of a common fund be that there would be a new bureaucracy and that bureaucracy would inevitably be dominate by the Group of 77 , that we should have the term of work of the common fund and its system stack against we as consumer .the bargaining chip , as it be , would be stack against we .
16780-1977-06-13.10.1.65.3-labour	there be no resistance to extend the scope of the International Monetary Fund to cover commodity because that be a bureaucracy which , by and large , be under the control of the industrialised country , and the entrenched voting power of the United States in particular .nor be there objection to bureaucracy which have an ultimate funding reserve in the hand of the creditor nation which would inevitably provide the bulk of the fund .but a new bureacracy be a different proposition .
21969-1977-06-13.11.1.28.15-conservative	"""again , it might be say that we be only part of the way .of course , we be only part of the way .but a very significant phrase be use by the hon .member for Wallasey when , have draw attention to the fact that in the last few year , upon the unrealistic separate accounting of the Fund , this country have draw more than it have put in , she opine that this would continue """" for several year yet . """"I do not doubt that ; but the course of development mean that it will eventually be the European Assembly , the European Commission , the european bureaucracy which will decide the entire pattern of social redistribution within the European Economic Community ."""
10544-1977-06-14.15.1.23.3-labour	why be it that when we have a Labour Government in power we be constantly undermine by civil servant and parliamentary draftsman who allow Departments to go unprepared on these matter ?someone in a managerial position should have say to the printer that they must first produce the Committee stage report when they return to work .time and time again we witness people in the bureaucracy of our Civil Service undermine the Government in their plan to get business through .
22170-1977-06-15.10.2.7.5-liberal	let we concentrate on get the available finance into the right area and not give another boom to office building .the opposition more than anyone — I support they on this — want to cut back bureaucracy .
18971-1977-06-15.10.2.8.3-conservative	we have argue this matter at length and research it carefully .on Second Reading we give abundant evidence that the ODP system be completely unnecessary and damaging to inner London rent and that it affect our competitiveness in insurance , commerce , banking and mercantile shipping .there be no need for it to be retain .the only justification be to maintain the present bureaucracy for long than be necessary .I hope that my hon .friend will adhere to our view and oppose the amendment .
22087-1977-06-17.3.4.8.1-conservative	no ; I believe that such a system would achieve very little .it would not reduce the number of separately mean - test benefit , it would not reduce the huge bureaucracy , and it would enshrine high income tax level .it would be difficult to put a tax credit system into operation without high income tax level .furthermore , such a system do not provide for the taxation of supplementary benefit .therefore , all those problem would still remain .I be anxious that we should not enter into this new system until we be sure that it would cure the problem to which I have allude .I be convinced that we need a much simple and more easily understand system , and I think that this could be achieve by implement the three or four proposal I have mention .
10511-1977-06-17.3.4.21.10-labour	I want my Government to receive the credit for put right a social problem in a socialist manner .that problem will never be solve — whatever the hon .Member for Norfolk , South may say — by a Tory Government .it would not be in their heart , politic or philosophy .it be in the interest of the Conservative Party that people should always be raise question about the operation of the Welfare State and the growth of the State bureaucracy .I do not like bureaucrat any more than anybody else do , and I spend most of my time battle against they .
10276-1977-06-20.8.1.15.8-conservative	"""there would also have to be a move forward with the concept of a tenant ' charter .there be a whole range of area in which bureaucracy deny to tenant a proper rôle in the management of their estate .the management side of the tenant ' charter be probably the most important , because it should be possible to devolve a degree of responsibility and thus eliminate a certain amount of bureaucratic influence if tenant play a great rôle .the Secretary of State should also encourage the experiment that be now be conduct by the GLC , where """" homesteading """" be become a new word in the domestic housing vocabulary .it be an admirable concept of self - help that should certainly be encourage across the country ."""
19420-1977-06-21.11.1.32.1-liberal	the Liberal Party believe that what industry most require from Parliament be not the prospect of drastic or dramatic change but continuity , stability and a fair degree of consensus .therefore I start with a point on which I be very glad to be at one with the hon .member for Gloucester ( Mrs. Oppen - heim ) , although I do not think that she be quite as anxious to be at one with I .it concern our suspicion about add to the bureaucracy .
19420-1977-06-21.11.1.37.1-liberal	we welcome the power and reject the eloquent argument against the power which we have hear during the last hour or so .it be the redundant bureaucracy that we oppose .all we ask be that as soon as the legality can be attend to — at the moment they prevent all this be carry out within the Fair Trading Act 1973 — this will be do .but there really can be no doubt with regard to the power themselves .our view be that the power be need , that they must be permanent , and that they must be elaborate and revise as the year go by .
21973-1977-06-21.11.1.38.1-conservative	do the hon .gentleman agree that we be not discuss the question of power , but that Amendment no .1 be deal with the institution itself ?I trust that he will agree , on reflection , that we be deal with redundant bureaucracy .
19420-1977-06-21.11.1.43.3-liberal	I quite understand that the large business , so often represent by hon .member on my right , can take these code in their stride because they have vast staff of train lawyer who can deal with code .but if one ask a small business man whether , give this wicked and unhappy world , he would rather have a byzantine code that one have to study for night on end with a towel over one 's head or a bureaucracy of flesh and blood , I be sure that we would get an answer for the latter .I be glad that the Committee , even though poor for the lack of a liberal presence , have the sense to get rid of the code within 12 month .
19420-1977-06-21.11.1.49.5-liberal	we shall come in due course to Amendment 80 , which , in a more positive form , embody the change that we should like to see .I hope that in the meantime we shall have some response from the Government on the point of the power remain , but the bureaucracy be greatly reduce , by the possibility , when the legislative situation allow , of an amalgamation with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission .
22172-1977-06-21.11.1.83.8-conservative	it be definitely arguable that split the responsibility between the Commission , the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission be likely to multiply bureaucracy — that can not be dispute — and to make the impact that can be effect by the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission significantly less than it need be .
10391-1977-06-21.11.1.95.4-conservative	I be concerned about the effect of the Price Commission on small business .the people in small business be already overlegislate about and overburden with bureaucracy .these be the people who can not cope and who will be badly affect by this proposal .they be normally competitive and keep their price down , give the housewife a good deal .a Price Commission which will far cut incentive and drive the self - employ out of business will do much long - term harm to our economy .
21990-1977-06-21.11.1.103.7-conservative	at the other end of the spectrum , people want less government in their life .they have to pay the taxis for the bureaucracy to administer the Price Commission .it be nonsense to expect people to be prepared to pay those taxis for a Price Commission which in the evolution of life may become unnecessary .
14200-1977-06-21.11.1.112.4-conservative	what worry I about the Government 's attitude to this amendment be that it illustrate their general attitude towards bureaucracy , and also towards private enterprise .it illustrate what the Labour Party have always believe — that the State and Whitehall know good .
14200-1977-06-21.11.1.172.1-conservative	the Minister may think it be a mistake to give way to I , but will he admit that what he have say mean that the Labour and Liberal Parties believe that bureaucracy and the State machine can solve the nation 's problem , whereas the conservative believe in trust people , reduce taxation , and let they get on with the job , and thus reduce inflation ?
22496-1977-06-21.12.3.269.5-conservative	recent evidence to the Select Committee on Science and Technology show that the great obstacle to innovation be not lack of idea or opportunity but shortage of available capital .every pound cut from profit be a pound less for investment .a firm of agricultural engineer recently write to the Small Business Bureau which have be collect evidence about the impact of this sort of legislation : if we exceed the Price Commission 's margin we shall still not be make enough profit to pay any tax at all .one business man write to the Bureau : talk to a number of acquaintence and friend in a similar situation to mine , run their own business , we be all heartily sick of bureaucracy and feel that maybe we should dispose of our business and let the state keep we , as they seem so keen on keep so many other .that attitude , unhappily , be grow .apart from the all - time record number of small business go into bankruptcy , the number which have voluntarily go into liquidation , which have voluntarily give up , have rise by 100 per cent .over the average for 1972–73 , the middle of the last Conservative Government .
19004-1977-06-21.12.3.306.2-conservative	my point be that the SNP attitude seem to be base on a closed economy , with a closed border , secure the employment by shut out all import .I dread to think of the price that would result in Scotland from such a shortsighted attitude .the only growth in employment that would be likely to result would be in the bureaucracy at St. Andrew 's House .

18622-1977-11-08.12.1.119.15-conservative	I ask the proponent of exchange control and great public investment in our industry — a policy promote by many in the Labour Party — to think through the proposition .first , the Exchequer proceed of North Sea oil will not be very large .they will be between £ 2 billion and £ 3 billion only .even if the Whitehall bureaucracy be able to pick winner — we have see its attempt at that one have only to look at the oil platform saga , which be a perfect example of whitehall picking winner — it be not the winner who will have any problem in find capital in the market , as the Wilson Committee will surely say ; it be the loser .
18622-1977-11-08.12.1.119.29-conservative	of course , there be many of our manufacturing industry that have make substantial progress and that would benefit from a great regime of freedom with regard to the exchange rate and less bureaucracy in the manner in which they operate overseas .
22529-1977-11-09.21.1.23.9-conservative	I put this argument to the House .one of the difficulty about devolve the scheme a long way down be that the accountability of fund to the House be make much more difficult .one of the great increase in bureaucracy in the Manpower Services Commission and throughout the Government service have come about through try to control accountability .I suggest to my right hon .friend the Member for Taunton ( Mr. du Cann ) , who be Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee , that the House ought now to see whether there be not well way of have accountability which do not involve the degree of bureaucracy and centralisation or regionalisation which have to take place at present .
21646-1977-11-09.21.1.52.3-labour	the question pose by the right hon .member for Lowestoft be a very fair one .how do we ensure accountability for the money which be to be spend on the youth opportunity programme without involve some great bureaucracy ?I think that the idea on which we be now work provide a large part of the answer to this question .the area board that will be responsible for approve the programme — the power will be devolve to they — will be comprise of people who be representative , in the true sense , of the community in the board area .the people who will be responsible for put up the project to they will be people who be representative of their own local community .in other word , the people who be involve in the programme will themselves determine the accountability in the sense of how the programme be carry out .the amount allocate , for which I shall be answerable to this House will be in direct proportion to the youth unemployment problem of the particular area .
22529-1977-11-09.21.1.53.1-conservative	may I say what I be try to get across to the House ?because of the need to account for every single penny , there be always a tendency to set up a bureaucracy .in a number of country this be not do .if anything go wrong here , the Minister be accountable for it .I believe that the more these scheme be devolve to the people who be really affect by they the well the scheme will be .on the other hand , I accept that there will be great danger of something go wrong .I think that a number of thing will go wrong .there might even be the odd scandal or two .but we have to get this into perspective , and I do not think that we do this in the House of Commons .that be what worry I very much about all these scheme .that be the point I be try to make .that be why I think that Richard O'Brien , for whom I have the great respect , feel that he be tie somewhat in have to have a bureaucratic set - up — I do not say that it be all that bureaucratic , but there be a degree of bureaucracy — in order to avoid the kind of thing to which I have refer .
21646-1977-11-09.21.1.54.1-labour	I do not know that Richard O'Brien would use exactly those word , but if he have imply that there be any bureaucracy , he may have in mind the way in which he have to run the Training Services Agency and the Employment Services Agency .I do not think that anyone could claim that work experience , job creation and similar project have a bureaucratic administration .if anything , we have gamble with some of they .I regret that some of they have fail , but 90 per cent .of they have be successful , and it be on that ground that I defend the programme before the House .
17691-1977-11-14.9.1.90.5-conservative	the tragedy be that what we do today will have its full effect upon succeed generation .we be one nation .we divide at peril to ourselves and to the delight only of our enemy .the Government seek to hand over the way but not the mean .the cost to Scotland will be an overwhelming bureaucracy — expensive and crush .we would be the most over - govern and the most expensively over - govern country in the world .in my view , the problem inherent in the Bill would result in the break - up of the United Kingdom .
22218-1977-11-14.9.1.100.3-labour	again , one of the danger in a narrow majority be that the right hon .Gentleman have to be in this House so much .but there be nearly 7,000 civil servant in Scotland whom he be suppose to control , so that when this kind of executive devolution go too far the danger be of government not only by bureaucracy but , it may well be , by a second - class bureaucracy without proper ministerial supervision .
21738-1977-11-14.9.1.104.7-liberal	why be the present Bill well ?first , the financial arrangement be well in two respect .there be the Government 's willingness to consider sympathetically — that be in the White Paper — direct taxation power if cost be meet .as the House will recall , we propose that income tax power be give to the Assembly .the Government demonstrate clearly that that would cost about £ 8 million directly if it be possible to vary the tax , which be the whole point of it anyway , and about £ 8 million indirectly , and that it would result in the necessary employment of about two 2,000 civil servant , who , ironically , would be place in England .I do not think that we in the Liberal Party could argue for cut down bureaucracy and , on the other hand , argue for a solution of that kind .

19169-1977-11-14.9.1.169.6-conservative	apart from the argument about more bureaucracy , more government and more taxation — powerful though they be in people 's mind — at the end of the day the key argument which will sway the people in Scotland — and which should sway the people of the United Kingdom as a whole , and would if they be give the chance — be the slippery slope argument .of course , I agree with my hon .friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns and the right hon .Member for Belfast , East ( Mr. Craig ) when they say that we should look at the way in which the House be run .of course we should consider possible change in the constitution .nobody be say that the status quo be totally satisfactory .what we be say be that this particular Bill be a bad Bill and that if it be implement it will lead we down the slippery slope towards the break - up of the United Kingdom .

19169-1977-11-30.8.1.15.5-conservative	why be industry and commerce in Scotland so implacably oppose to this Bill in any shape or form ?it be not only that they fear — quite rightly — that the Scottish Assembly would have the power to increase and impose more taxis , as for example , to derate industrial premise as it would under the present system — a subject that we could not debate last night due to the guillotine .commerce and industry be also opposed to the Bill because of the endless intervention that they would have from all these Secretaries of State and Assistant Secretaries of State , with the concomitant bureaucracy and red tape .

22565-1977-11-30.8.1.62.3-conservative	one of the reason why we be suppose to be have this set - up , this Assembly , be that the exist situation be suppose to be remote .we be suppose to be remote .if the hon .member for Inverness a few week ago be in his constituency see his constituent and the hon .member for Dunbartonshire , East ( Mrs. Bain ) be to come and see I , that mean that we be very closely in touch and we be not remote .it be an absolute untruth to say that the present system be remote , except in the sense that there be too many official and that it be too difficult to get to the seat of power .have more assistant , with great bureaucracy , and with the ten- dency to have more interference , will create the very thing that it be suppose to be cure — remoteness .
16393-1977-11-30.8.1.106.2-conservative	I believe it to be a natural and inevitable compulsion upon anyone with the power of any office in the bureaucracy , and frequently in politic , to attempt to enlarge his sphere of influence and therefore to elevate the strength of his position by enlarge the number of people who assist he .the little man work in an office with no assistant be not so important as the man in another office with 10 assistant .that be an inevitable characteristic .it be a characteristic of regionalisation .when that happen it be not that the pyramid get small , it be that a whole layer underneath it raise it up and so the environmental planning officer be now much more important than the former sanitary inspector .
10591-1977-11-30.8.1.109.9-conservative	the other reason why we should restrict the number of Under - Secretaries , or whatever they be to be call , be that we shall have a competitive situation .I think that the hon .member for West Lothian ( Mr. Dalyell ) would certainly accept this .if we have what be in effect a Scottish Education Minister in Edinburgh and a Scottish Education Minister down here , obviously they will want equality of knowledge and undoubtedly they will have a bureaucracy add on , with one or two more civil servant to provide more information .
10591-1977-11-30.8.1.111.7-conservative	I ask the Committee to accept the amendment , which will put some restraint on this appalling confusion .let we also throw out the clause , because it will create extra bureaucracy , will be most expensive , and will bring about such a sense of frustration that eventually it will lead to the break - up of Britain .

19169-1977-12-06.6.5.20.3-conservative	as I have say before in this Committee — no doubt I shall say it again , because it be very important — one of the main reason why , at the end of the day , I believe that a referendum in Scotland will throw out this Bill be precisely that the people of Scotland will realise what they be let themselves in for , in term of money — endless extra expense , into which I will not go now , for the extra civil servant , the bureaucracy and all the rest of it .

18577-1977-12-08.11.1.6.6-conservative	I turn now to Clause II , item 6 of the schedule , and emphasise that it be the small business , not the big international corporation , which be the backbone of the Northern Ireland economy .my information be that very severe pressure have be put upon small business by the present Government through some of their general economic legislation for the United Kingdom .in particular , the pre - sure of bureaucracy and the growth of control under this Government have make life very much more difficult for the small business man in Northern Ireland , just as in the rest of the United Kingdom .I be talk to a few of they yesterday .

18042-1978-02-15.12.3.41.2-labour	I share the view of the right hon .Member for Orkney and Shetland ( Mr. Grimond ) that in future Scotland will be very much over - govern .before I come to the House — perhaps this explain my interest in the Bill — I be a member of the council in Aberdeen .it be an all - purpose authority .at that time there be two layer of government inflict upon the citizen of Aberdeen .there be the local council and the Westminster Parliament .I venture to suggest that the citizen be well satisfied with that arrangement .certainly , a number of the elector vote against my party from time to time , but , in the main , they keep it in power .not too often do they vote against it .we now find that in Aberdeen there be the community council , the district council and the regional council with its headquarters in Aberdeen .it be a substantial bureaucracy .
19169-1978-02-15.12.3.76.2-conservative	the central argument advance by my hon .friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns , step tentatively for the first time on to ground which I , among other , have already occupy , be that the whole Scottish Assembly exercise would be an exercise in over - government , involve increase bureaucracy and cost .for I , the central reason for oppose the Bill be the risk that it pose for the break - up of the United Kingdom .but there be also subsidiary reason for opposse the Bill , and any way in which we can reduce the number of Assemblymen , the number of bureaucrat and the power of intervention , muddle and interference please I .
16836-1978-02-16.10.5.60.1-conservative	I know that my hon .friend have a deep - seat hatred of the bureaucrat and particularly of the bureaucratic process .I wonder whether he would like to comment upon the report of a speech by Mr. Roy Jenkins which be contain in the Times of 15th February in which he say that in direct election to the European Assembly the Commission will do all that it can to ensure that the election be fight on the major issue .what right have any bureaucracy to interfere in our election like that ?how do he square that with his view ?
19152-1978-02-16.10.5.67.5-labour	the Commission be a powerful body and have a powerful bureaucracy .it as a considerable information service , and method of persuasion and idea which go around .therefore , it be more likely that the Assembly will , by various method , be persuade that the Commission 's proposal be the right one .it be much more likely that it will go on rubber - stamping , will amplify , and , in the word of Mr. Tindemans , give democratic legitimacy to the proposal of the Commission .
17433-1978-02-21.14.1.71.4-labour	I agree that in establish the agency we do not want to set up a great bureaucracy to deal with the matter .in many respect , the figure of 5 per cent .of the cost in the original proposition be a vast exaggeration .I do not think that that will be necessary .we can start on a modest basis and see how we proceed .that be the Government 's proposal .we think that it would be absurd to go along with an elaborate proposal for member have to pay the cost of the service .that be why we bring forward our proposal for payment .I hope that the House will accept what we be propose .I underline all the undertaking I have give about come back to the House .
21796-1978-02-22.10.1.48.5-conservative	but , as we all know , at the same time as government have grow more and interfere more , the more we find Parliament less able to cope .bill go through improperly examine — as we see with this Bill today — order and regulation often go undebated , and the report of nationalise industry and public body go unconsidered .furthermore , the bureaucracy seem to have a life and will of their own , beyond the control of politician and close to any access by ordinary people .that be true of the United Kingdom at large , and perhaps even more true of Scotland with its separate arrangement and government administration .
18267-1978-02-22.10.1.66.4-conservative	it seem to I that no case have be make for devolution accord to the provision of the Bill on their merit .what have be put forward by the Secretary of State and other be a series of statement which be act of faith — that after this Bill be enact thing will be well , government will be improve , the burden on the Secretary of State will be lessen and the control of the Civil Service will be well .no one have yet show how by add another tier of bureaucracy to the pile under which we labour already , another tier of elect representative will be able to exercise well total control than that which we would get by simplify and improve the exist structure .
21989-1978-02-22.10.1.118.5-labour	I have try to total the number of job that be in the gift of the Secretary of State .my arithmetic may not be accurate but I believe that they total 5,083 .of these , 90 be pay job .there be 204 ad hoc body in Scotland under the control of the Secretary of State .I do not include body that be appoint jointly with other Ministries .Scotland be a different area of the country administer by a single Department — a competent and capable Department — surround by 204 ad hoc authority , appoint but not clearly responsible to anyone and not check or debate in this House .this mean that a preponderance of policy on health , education , housing and road , for want of well thing , emerge from this bureaucracy .
18528-1978-02-22.17.1.48.7-labour	the hon .Member for Northampton , South ( Mr. Morris ) raise the issue of branch council .the question of interim suspension have also be raise .perhaps I should deal with those matter fairly generally .this country seem to be move towards the concept of devolution , and this be recognise by the institution of branch council for England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland under the Bill .the hon .Member wonder , as do the hon .member for Walsall , North ( Mr. Hodgson ) , whether this might lead to a proliferation of bureaucracy .
18528-1978-02-22.17.1.48.8-labour	we be empower the General Medical Council to set up these council .they will have to be set up under the Bill , but the GMC will decide , in the light of practical requirement , whether the branch council will be use .it will decide that in the light of pragmatic experience .if it come to the conclusion that there be no justifiable need for the branch council , it need not use they .I assume that in such circumstance the council need not meet , and they certainly would not require any of the elaborate bureaucracy of which hon .member , be rightly afraid , in view of the experience we have have in the National Health Service over the past few year .
16454-1978-02-23.8.1.2.2-conservative	"""I should like to ask the Minister a couple of question .first , will he promise the House that the local authority concern will know within one week of today exactly what be mean by the promise to pay 75 per cent .of all emergency expenditure in excess of a penny rate ?I stress the word """" within one week of today """" because the Minister will be aware that after the East anglian flooding , which take place as long as six week ago on 11th January , the local authority there still do not know exactly what the phrase mean , have not be able to pay out one penny , and do not know what the Government will be give they .the Minister must make the same sort of lightning visitation to the bureaucracy in this context as he make to the West Country .they must have information within one week ."""
21743-1978-02-23.8.1.3.2-labour	as for the hon .Gentleman 's two question , I can say now that the undertaking we have give about local authority expenditure mean what it say .there be no need to wait for one week .I assume that the hon .Gentleman be refer to something say yesterday by the Association of District Councils to the effect that there be bureaucracy .I be able categorically to deny that .there be no foundation at all for the statement make yesterday by that organisation .
18450-1978-02-23.11.1.44.24-conservative	worse still , hon .member , face with the problem of how good to elect the European Parliament , direct all their attention to snarl about salary and whine that the House may lose power and influence to the European Parliament — this House , which have already surrender most of our power and most of our sovereignty to the bureaucracy of Whitehall or to the Trades Union Congress , and which be about to hand over what remain power we have to Edinburgh and to Cardiff .
18683-1978-02-24.3.1.3.28-conservative	on look back , I like to think that I try to be a good employer ; I have be bring up in the right tradition .compare with the rigidity of private and public large corporate company , I find a willingness , loyalty , zeal and enthusiasm that have be the true example of the strength of british industry .it be only now that I be fully aware of my good fortune 25 year ago to have be part of that spontaneous relationship which I have see in farm and other small business that I visit .I have have occasion to work on or visit one farm off and on for about 40 year .it be once my second home .that be why with the hon .Member of Wolverhampton , South - East ( Mr. Edwards ) I have be keen to sponsor co - ownership group in the House of Commons .formalism , legalism and bureaucracy must not be allow to snuff out the small business man .
19476-1978-02-24.3.1.5.13-labour	the procedure suggest in the Bill , if it could be understand , would mean more paper work in the preparation of notice and counter - notice .hon .member often talk of bureaucracy and of put burden on employer .the Bill would put further burden on employer .
18469-1978-02-24.3.1.131.4-conservative	it have be say that the unfair dismissal procedure be put on the statute book by a Conservative Government .we be not quarrel with the principle .what I say be that we need to raise the threshold of bureaucracy beneath which small business can flourish .we be talk about raise the threshold of vat .let we try to raise the threshold of bureaucracy so that small business do not suffer as many of they be now suffer .I refer early to the Government spokesman we have hear today .I do so because the Chancellor of the Duchy would no doubt have say something totally different today .it be not a conservative spokesman but the chan- cellor of the Duchy who go into print in the Sunday Times of 27th November say : we must be careful that the Employment Protection Act be not turn into an Employment Destruction Act .the Chancellor of the Duchy recognise what be happen .he be on record as have say the same sort of thing elsewhere .he recognise the fear of business man .this fear be found not on a myth but on experience .
18869-1978-02-27.6.2.109.2-conservative	finally , if we want to have trial expedite , the Lord Chancellor should appoint a work party to look into the working of the Courts Act which have now be run for six year .with my hon .and learn Friend the Member for Runcorn ( Mr. Carlisle ) and Lord Hailsham , I introduce that Act .there should be a work party to see how much bureaucracy have be inject into the operation of that Act .case be not be deal with as efficiently as they should be .
19097-1978-02-28.4.6.7.1-conservative	have the Minister see the article in the Guardian of today , which suggest that , like the job creation scheme , the youth opportunity scheme in Merseyside may be be handicap by the weight of the requirement from bureaucracy and the additional staff be employ ?will he look into that area and see that this programme be not be handicap ?
16418-1978-02-28.8.1.2.9-conservative	the Act be suppose to accelerate the supply of build land and speed up the house - building programme .it have have precisely the opposite effect .planning delay already add hundred of pound to the cost of new house and the Act have make thing bad .there have be ominous sign that the shortage of build land will lead to few home and high price .it be true that there have emerge from the Department of the Environment and the scottish and Welsh Offices vast quantity of Government paper .indeed , the bureaucracy do roll on .
21851-1978-03-02.10.1.20.9-plaid_cymru	why this major difference make between Wales and Scotland ?it be not because a legislature be good for Scotland but not good for Wales .London government have not consider what be good for Wales as a nation .the difference of treatment be cause by the difference between the strength of the two national party , and the Labour Party in Wales be induce to accept an unjustified discrimination against Wales and a discrimination between two nation which have the same kind of problem and background .in May 1976 the Labour Party 's Welsh Conference , attend by Welsh Labour Members of Parliament , come out overwhelmingly for an elect Assembly and , incidentally , against a referendum , and this decision be reaffirm by the 1977 conference .despite the enormous growth of the power of the State , the enormous growth of bureaucracy and the enormous growth of centralism , the Welsh be to be deny the power to make their own policy decision , and the party which have for so long promise Wales a Parliament again fail the country .
22530-1978-03-02.10.1.110.3-conservative	my second reason be the increase bureaucracy that would result from Amendment no .48 .I do not like bureaucracy of any sort , but I detest it when there be no good reason for it , and I can see no good reason here .
21720-1978-03-02.10.1.175.5-plaid_cymru	the argument will not stop here .in last night 's debate hon .member say that if we be to stop this Bill the whole argument would go away .that be say many time last night .but it be not true .similarly , in tonight 's debate , the argument about legislative power for the Assembly will not go away .tonight we be try to decide how we can have an effective Assembly as the next step in the development of Wales .this be a process .it be a step forward but not an end in itself .in a sense , it be set up a tier of Welsh democracy on top of the exist bureaucracy in Wales .we can not do this unless we have the transfer of legislative power as a whole and not merely the transfer of subordinate legislation .this be my major argument .
21720-1978-03-02.10.1.178.5-plaid_cymru	the Assembly can not hope to have a total oversight of the function of area health authority or of its own internal health service bureaucracy in the Welsh Office if only some of the mental health power be devolve .I choose only that one example , but there be other throughout the legislation which be to be devolve .they occur in planning , education and housing .in those area of social legislation the Assembly 's function be not clearly define .where they be den the division of power be unreasonable because the Assembly will have responsibility for some aspect of social policy while be unable to take a broad view .
10635-1978-03-07.17.1.41.3-plaid_cymru	there be area of great concern , most of which relate to the growth of bureaucracy and the clogging - up of the system of local government because of the present structure .one problem that arise frequently in public and private meeting be plan .planning application be submit to district council , move up to county council to see whether they be within the framework of a county plan and downward to community coun- cil for their blessing .they can also go backwards and forwards on technical point .I be tell that if they be return , reverse or stop at every point at which they can be dispute , they could be stop on 24 occasion .
21904-1978-03-07.17.1.71.2-labour	I be say that we can not give the power to the county because they be not small enough to be near to the people , and we can not give the power to the district because they will not be large enough .we can not think in term of each of 37 borough council in Wales have a director of education .we shall have a growth of bureaucracy .
22195-1978-03-07.17.1.169.1-labour	I come back to the alternative of leave it to the civil servant .I assure the hon .member for Carmarthen ( Mr. Evans ) that if it be to be do by civil servant they would not be civil servant in the Welsh Office in Gwydyr House .they would be locate in Cardiff .I do not suggest that the hon .Gentleman would want that .when there have be civil servant in the Welsh Office in Gwydyr House in the past they have always be attack on the ground of be a great bureaucracy .
14158-1978-03-08.8.1.22.7-labour	"""what action can the Committee take ?my amendment be tough .it say : in no circumstance shall it be regard as appropriate that any person be not appoint in any role as an officer or servant of the Assembly because of lack of knowledge of Welsh """" .we want to ensure that people be judge on their merit and not on whether they be Welsh - speak or English - speaking .if we be to have this Civil Service , this swollen bureaucracy , we must see that it be a meritocracy .we must ensure that those appoint be appoint solely by reason of their capacity .it must not depend upon the fact that they be bear in a particular area of the principality and be bring up speak Welsh ."""
21902-1978-03-08.8.1.75.13-conservative	to sum up , we shall vote against the motion that clause 25 should stand part of the Bill as a protest against the increase in bureaucracy that it will undoubtedly create .it be not just the increase of 1,150 refer to by the hon .member for Pontypool but the host that will come with they or after they as a result of this open - ended commitment in clause 25 .it be all very well for the Government to talk of review local government and imply surreptitiously that there will then be a cut - back .by their own admission , there can be no real change there for year to come , and meanwhile Wales be to be load with this extra tier of bureacracy .nor be it likely that there will be cut - back elsewhere to compensate for the increase in Wales .
18046-1978-03-09.18.1.223.3-conservative	I turn first to the question whether the Select Committee have information withhold from it and whether it be entitle to it .I sympathise with the view express by Ministers and by Sir Charles Villiers .we do not want to create another layer of bureaucracy .we do not want to add to the reporting system .
17039-1978-03-10.5.1.12.7-conservative	it would , in my view , be a disastrous programme if it be ever implement .it would destroy Britain 's economy by remove incentive .in so do , it would drive down the standard of living of our people still far .it would take away choice — and choice be essential to liberty .it would make more and more of our people pensioner of the State and dependant of the bureaucracy .it be a programme which the british people do not want and for which they will not vote .I think that the Prime Minister be quite right , tactically , to try to keep it out of sight while he do his cuddly bear act .
22551-1978-03-10.5.1.30.10-conservative	nationalisation be only part of the propose advance of the State .read through the page of Labour 's programme for 1976 it can be see that on almost every subject face the country , from the future of agricultural land to the future of youth service , there be proposal for new board , new commission , new bureaucracy , new legislation , new control , a strong National Enterprise Board , more state hold company and a vast addition to the already top - heavy bureaucracy from which the country suffer .
17823-1978-03-10.5.1.48.5-liberal	I be sure that all hon .member would agree with the Labour Party 's aim of justice , freedom , democracy and security .the question be whether Labour 's programme will achieve those aim .if the programme be to be implement , the whole country would suffocate under a blanket of bureaucracy .the right hon .member for Newham , North - East ( Mr. Prentice ) be right about that .it would not result in a more prosperous , democratic country with great security .it would , in the long run , mean the gradual creation of a new elite of officialdom .it be not that the eventual aim of the Labour Party be in dispute , but that its method will prevent those aim from be achieve .
10316-1978-03-10.5.1.155.5-conservative	this attitude underline the main difference between we .despite what the hon .Member for Walton say , I do not think that he believe in encourage individual choice and freedom .I believe that he be much happy if he be urge and argue and fight basically for a collectivist approach to many of our problem .that be why we get such appalling and irrelevant rubbish as the document under discussion today .Labour 's programme for 1976 would not produce the irreversible shift of power to the ordinary people , not a bit of it .it would produce an irreversible shift of power to bureaucracy , produce one committee after another .there would be a shift of power to the State and it would end up by destroy the fundamental independence and freedom of the people live in this country .
14152-1978-03-13.6.3.150.7-conservative	this be a gloomy list of change .be the politician to blame ?as power have pass from the Member of Parliament , first to his party , then to the Executive and now to the bureaucracy and beyond , so popular democracy have be substitute for the parliamentary kind .we be only too keen to make sure , first , what it be that the people want and then , secondly , to pronounce ourselves in favour of it .in which country in Western Europe be the public in favour of defence spending when they be not constantly and courageously remind of its vital necessity .
22529-1978-03-14.9.1.10.11-conservative	I be worried , as , I think , many hon .member be , about the growth of bureaucracy that be overtake certain section of what might be call the training industry .I think that the House and the Government have a duty to watch that carefully .whether my Government be right to make the Manpower Services Commission independent of the Department of Employment I just do not know , but I have an awful feeling that there be a degree of duplication and a creep in of bureaucracy that have to be watch , because if it be not keep carefully under control it will lead to a certain disillusionment on the part of both side of industry .I hope that the Government will bear in mind the fear that bureaucracy be begin to take over in the training industry .
10511-1978-03-14.9.1.16.4-labour	one such matter that have never be debate substantially in the House be the hiving off of the activity of the Department of Employment by the Conservatives .I give the right hon .Member his due .he do not cover up the fact that it be his Government who set up the Manpower Services Commission , the Training Services Agency and the Employment Services Agency , a grow train of bureaucracy for which he and his right hon .and hon .friend now castigate the Government .

17067-1978-03-14.9.1.24.2-labour	dare I admit that I be not an engineer by training ?however , I recognise the crucial importance of the industry to our economy .the hon .member for Truro ( Mr. Penhaligon ) refer to the development of North Sea oil , but what really intrigue I be the confession make by the right hon .member for Lowestoft ( Mr.prior ) .I recall that there be considerable resentment about the levy of the various industry training board when the Conservatives set to work in devise the 1973 Act , and , in many respect , I think that we be suffer from the way in which that piece of legislation downgrade the individual role and capacity of industry training board .if we be now suffer from the surfeit of bureaucracy , the Conservatives be largely responsible for it .
22533-1978-03-14.9.1.40.9-labour	I do not think that any complaint of bureaucracy stem from the creation of the Manpower Services Commission as a body independent of the Government .I think that conservative Members be right to hand over training and the employment service to employer , the trade union and the local authority , because when they have take decision they be able to deliver in a way that the Government can not do .however , I agree that there be problem , and the right hon .Gentleman have speak of they in a different context .
22533-1978-03-14.9.1.40.10-labour	one of the difficulty that we have in a long chain of command be that we be try to control the use of public money and therefore introduce mechanism of accountability which in turn become bureaucratic irritation to people in the front line try to get on with the job of training .I think that the Manpower Services Commission have to look carefully at its relationship with the EITB and other to make certain that there be no more bureaucracy than be need to give we a reasonable degree of accountability .
22533-1978-03-14.9.1.40.13-labour	I do not accept the description of the gravy train and bureaucracy .the right hon .member for Lowestoft do not use that expression .
14158-1978-03-16.8.1.4.2-labour	secondly , while there may be many attraction in a no - fault scheme , will not the Prime Minister acknowledge that it be important to realise that it be a scheme which , apart from cause an increase in the price of petrol , could have burgeon bureaucracy and could be a scheme which could mean that the reckless could benefit as a result of the care of other motorist ?these matter require great surveillance .
17853-1978-03-16.10.1.69.4-conservative	in addition , a great deal of public expenditure in this country be now devoted to the administration of bureaucracy , and that be a positive deterrent to enterprise .member will have see yesterday , for example , a story in the Daily Mail about one of Britain 's lead housebuilde company pull out of housebuilde because , to quote from its chairman : it be simply not worth our while to continue .many of our manager be have to spend most of their time deal with central and local government regulation .one of our director spend 70 per cent .of his time deal with planning appeal .this kind of work be simply not cost - effective .virtually every site we want to develop be the subject of planning appeal .the bureaucracy of the administration , for which we be pay , for which the taxpayer be pay , be stand in the way of enterprise and growth .those be the reason why public spending have to be rein back to take a small share of national wealth each year .that be what the Chancellor describe as his intention when he write to the Director of the IMF in 1976 .in December 1976 the Chancellor say : an essential element of the Government 's strategy will be a continue and substantial reduction over the next few year in the share of resource require for the public sector .whatever happen to those good intention ?they be still entirely valid .
17853-1978-03-16.10.1.73.4-conservative	"[ hon .member : """" no money . """" ]that be exactly the point .we have get the entire legislative apparatus of the Community Land Act multiply and increase the process of administration in local authority up and down the country .ask local councillor the extent to which they be have to take account of these legislative provision , although they be not fertilise with money .the bureaucracy be there but the purpose for which it be intend be not .so it should be repeal forthwith ."""
17154-1978-03-17.6.1.48.7-labour	in his concluding remark he mention the need for three new structure .we be a little cautious about create new structure , particularly when the whole bureaucracy be under attack .as for organise the family at community level and spread around good practice , there be nothing in what the Government be do to prevent that .I be sure that in some district this be happen , with the voluntary body come together .we would do nothing to discourage that .indeed , we would do all we can to encourage it .
16922-1978-03-20.12.8.20.23-conservative	I believe that there be a lot that we can do to cut back the bureaucracy still far through natural wastage — and do not let I hear from the Minister that the 1974 reorganisation be responsible for all of it .if he have read the Select Committee report he will know that from the end of the 1960 the NHS administration be grow steadily .it be true that there be a hiccup in 1974 , but it be little more than a hiccup in what have already be establish over the previous 10 year as a grow administration .
21704-1978-03-22.8.6.12.18-labour	the hon .member for Mid - Oxon ask how the Commission get its political information .the hon .Gentleman ask an astute question .the Commission be often deride as be an enormous bureaucracy .it be a terrible bureaucracy but it be not an enormous one ; it have its problem about get political information .
16392-1978-04-05.8.13.124.8-labour	that must strike my right hon .and hon .friend as peculiar , but there be other area where the hon .Gentleman have a different conception .he say that he want resource allocation in Wales to be more cost - effective .so do i.socialist be by nature good husbander of the nation 's finance .we have a case to prove .we want to ensure the maximum beneficial use of resource .that be why we be in favour of planning .we want resource allocation to be make more cost - effective .I do not see how we can do that when we duplicate bureaucracy , when we duplicate civil service , when we have resource allocate to an Assembly that be unnecessary and unwanted .I do not understand how we can have more effective resource allocation if we be multiply tier of government and duplicate function .
17067-1978-04-06.9.1.47.6-labour	the second area I want to deal with relate to the management consultancy role of the CDA .like my hon .friend the Member for Luton , East ( Mr. Clemitson ) , I do not want to see a settle bureaucracy .I want to see an active task force in the CDA , one that be able to offer what be so often lack to people who be interesting in set up a co - operative — professional , sympathetic advice on legal and financial matter , taxation question , product viability and marketing skill and question of personnel and training .
18135-1978-04-06.9.1.51.10-labour	I agree with my hon .friend the Member for Luton , East ( Mr. Clemitson ) that the method by which agency personnel will be appoint as describe in the Bill should be only temporary .it be unfortunate that , willy - nilly , we be set up yet another group that will be the subject of ministerial patronage .I understand that in the initial stage it may be necessary to rely on unilateral appointment by a Secretary of State , but I hope that within the three to five year specify in the Bill we can gradually move away from that .I hope that the Bill will be amend to indicate the possibility that appointment to the Agency will not indefinitely be within the sole bailiwick of the Secretary of State , because this can encourage a sort of authoritarianism and bureaucracy that would be unfortunate .
22158-1978-04-11.8.1.25.5-labour	there be the additional £ 50 million for the National Health Service .as the hon .Member for Caernarvon say , this additional amount be merely a drop in the ocean .I suppose that to a very limited extent it will help to reduce waiting list .we know that standard in the Service have be deteriorate for quite a long time .I know that that be so in Newport .a good deal of the deterioration stem from the reorganisation of the Service carry out by the Conservative Government under the direction of the right hon .member for Leeds , North - East ( Sir K.

21942-1978-04-12.9.1.7.2-labour	I should like to offer one suggestion which I think could help .I do not want to set up a big bureaucracy , but perhaps someone at county council or district council level could look at all the problem that we be face in the rural area .for example , I know that the county council in my area be cut service as fast as it can .but where there be a service , such as a mobile library , there be no reason why we can not consider the possibility of an official give out pension off the same bus as it go around or perhaps collect prescription so that they may be dispense .this be an easy suggestion , and it be possible that it would not work , but I think that we should have somebody look at the combined social service and the problem that exist in specific area .

10583-1978-07-10.15.1.38.1-conservative	we have in this debate demonstrate that we have now reach the stage where we can discuss the institution and document of the Community with the same detached and critical scrutiny that we apply to their british equivalent without call in question our commitment to british membership of the EEC , in most case .indeed , it be only by such a critical approach that constructive progress can be make in improve the many present defect in the functioning of both the british and the european bureaucracy and ensure their proper subordination to the political will of the democratically elect national government and Parliaments .
10583-1978-07-10.15.1.40.7-conservative	no doubt Commissioner Tugendhat deserve considerable credit for limit this overall increase , but it be still too much , and that be my answer to the hon .member for Swindon ( Mr. Stoddart ) , because percentage increase of public expenditure in the range of 12 per cent .to 15 per cent .be very substantial , even when set against the growth rate of the most dynamic economy in the Community , partticularly in the light of the Prime Minister 's report to we early this afternoon that growth rate within the whole Community be likely to be low than expect .I agree with the hon .member for Swindon that public expenditure , like bureaucracy and corporatism , demand at least as much supervision and vigilance in the european as in the national context .
10583-1978-07-10.15.1.40.9-conservative	of course , it will be argue , and be argue , that the proportion of national budgets—2½ per cent.—committed to the european institution be still relatively tiny and that increase in Community spending should lead to compensate reduction in national expenditure on the same service , but those who take that point of view be , I think , subscribe to the triumph of hope over experience , because we all know that expenditure programme develop a dynamism of their own and once start not only tend to grow fast than anticipate but become difficult to rein back .that have be the undoing of the present British Labour Government .secondly , while the replacement of national expenditure by community expenditure sound fine in theory , may it not in practice lead to a great deal of duplication of effort and expenditure unless the european bureaucracy turn out to be very different from all other bureaucracy the world have see so far ?

10011-1978-07-26.11.1.18.8-labour	since there be this late inclusion of local government reorganisation , which have no necessary nexus with devolution , some cynical character might ask the Government 's motivation .do we expect that the Government will use the prospect of local government reform in the referendum campaign to bring every discontent area into the pro - devolution net ?can we imagine the Under - Secretary , my hon .friend the Member for Rhondda ( Mr. Jones ) trudge up to the two cottage in the village of Gilfach Goch , ask the occupant whether they want reorganisation of local government , and if so , tell they that it be necessary for they to vote for this vast , expensive bureaucracy which be the only mean of local government reorganisation ?

18210-1978-07-28.3.1.77.13-labour	I want to put this matter into its context .my judgment be that the House of Commons be no real challenge to the power of bureaucracy and the power of Government in this country as at present constitute .we must revise the way in which we work so that we can take a real share in decision - making .we can not go on with the tradition which have come down to we since the sixteenth century that we simply correct Government decision after they have be make — that we be the well after the event .the fact that we have the party structure and that we have a systematised way of express opposition , which simply mean that we can delay thing for a little while but in the end the power of the whip will decide , mean that the decision when take by the Cabinet be almost always irrevocable .
18210-1978-07-28.3.1.77.15-labour	therefore , if we wish to influence the Government and , more important , if we wish to check the power of the bureaucracy , we must be involve in decision - taking before the decision be make .that require that we go over to the kind of powerful Select Committees which amass the evidence and evaluate it before it go to Ministers and before the final decision be take .this call for a Member of Parliament entirely different in kind from the Member we have today .

22085-1978-08-01.6.1.40.1-conservative	I believe that there be a strong case for delay the beginning of the Summer recess beyond 3rd August , particularly as we may well be talk about not just the date of the Summer recess but the date of the end of this Parliament .my view be base on the need for this House to consider a matter of grow public concern — namely , the rapid spread of bureaucracy by the proliferation of unelected , unrepresentative body beyond the reach of Parliament and in many instance not accountable to anyone for the expenditure of large and grow sum of public money .I refer , of course , if I may coin a phrase , to the quango explosion .hon .member on both side of the House have indicate their concern about the extent to which individual Ministers be bypass parliamentary check .they be do this by exercise a grow power of personal patronage that currently fill 8,500 pay and about 25,000 unpaid , but influential , appointment .

18724-1978-11-13.8.1.61.12-labour	one of my fear be that the establishment of this new organisation may lead to great bureaucracy and administrative clumsiness .like all other drawing board structure , it be frightening in its diagrammatic shape .my concern be that we should not have too many clinically qualified people carry out committee chore .nursing be concern primarily with patient .it would be a tragedy if the bedside be empty to fill the committee room .this fear be share by other , follow the costly restructuring carry out in 1973 by the right hon .member for Leeds , North - East ( Sir K.

18528-1978-11-13.8.1.119.6-labour	therefore , there be no obvious case for say that a fresh bureaucracy be be create .indeed , to a large extent we be move away from bureaucracy because we be move towards a substantial element of democracy in the nursing profession .the eventual machinery which we be create by this Bill will ensure that the vast majority of member of the four national board , and of the Central Council , will be elect by the various member of the nursing profession .

10565-1979-05-17.11.1.80.17-conservative	the partnership confine itself to a specific area which be slightly large than the pocket of deprivation envisage under the original urban aid and community development project , but not quite as large as the entire city area .this , then , be a mix of the pocket of deprivation theory and the city as a whole theory .the Government say that money be to be pump into the inner area .however , less money have be pump into the inner area than be take away by successive cut in public spending on , for example , improvement grant .therefore , the Government take with one hand and give back with another , and the end result have be a build - up in bureaucracy , an increase number of meeting and committee and no radical proposal for change or improve the inner area .
22347-1979-05-17.11.1.100.6-conservative	I also emphasise the considerable ac - vantage in save maintenance cost and bureaucracy among council .many council get snow under with bureaucracy in run property .however , I see a considerable problem face the Government over the sale of council house .under our district council , which be Conservative control , it take on average eight and a half to nine month from the time of the inquiry to the time the council house be sell .this be because of the lack of motivation on the part of the housing officer to get rid of the house .possibly they regard the sale as an erosion of their power .in my council office , which I know well , there be 13 different department through which the request for the sale must bounce before the lucky tenant actually become the owner .that be the problem that we face with a Conservative - control council .I be appal at the thought of the problem that we shall face with Labour - control district council .I believe that the delay in the machinery of administration will stretch well over a year .we must consider this and think about the introduction of possible incentive to council officer to get these sale through .
19097-1979-05-17.11.1.102.6-conservative	the burden of criticism be twofold .one criticism be that under Labour the organisation be extremely bureaucratic and considerable sum of money be be filter through a vast operation .curiously enough , the partnership area , which be suppose to break down that bureaucracy , in turn create their own bureaucracy .in Manchester we have the absurd situation where , because everybody want to consult everybody else , the consultation procedure create its own bureaucracy .we experience the partnership bureaucracy talk to the local authority bureaucracy , which in turn talk to the consultation bureaucracy .so it have go on .
10019-1979-05-18.7.1.63.11-conservative	how will all these trend affect the old man in the Kremlin who be attempt to impose an obsolete and humanely - repugnant regime through a constipate bureaucracy with a stagnant economy — or , more importantly , their successor once they have emerge after the traditional and inevitable power struggle ?
19398-1979-05-21.6.1.3.2-labour	it be quite the reverse with the Secretary of State for Industry .far from have a clean sheet , he seem to be obsess with old scrap paper .the Daily Express tell we that the right hon .Gentleman be refuse to use Departmental notepaper for anything but official letter .his sum , note , comment and philosophical doodling be write on scrap paper or back of old news handout .if the right hon .Gentleman run short of scrap paper , I advise he to send to his old Department , the Department of Health and Social Security , for the document involve in the reorganisation of the National Health Service , the most monstrous bureaucracy ever create in this country .there be a load of old rubbish there which could be put to well use .
21954-1979-05-21.6.1.37.10-conservative	I only hope that the stultifying effect of year of Socialism and hostility to small firm have not completely drain the entrepreneurial spirit from our people .it be suggest that this have happen in an article in the Sunday Telegraph yesterday by Mr. Graham Turner .if that be so , I suggest that people should look at the ugandan asian shopkeeper in my constituency .they be well practiser of private enterprise than anyone I can think of , and most of they have start from nothing .there be a vast amount of work to be do , especiaally in the service sector , and there be plenty of scope for small firm and individual .this will be do once the Government back away the clammy cobwebs of bureaucracy and oppressive taxation .
10565-1979-05-22.4.8.3.1-conservative	be the Minister aware that , to effect saving , local authority be cut grant to the voluntary youth organisation rather than make cut in their own bureaucracy ?will he look at the London borough of Islington , where the grant to Task Force be threaten to be cut by as much as 25 per cent .this year , although it have work for the past 14 year in the borough recruit young people to give community service to old and lonely people ?
21730-1979-05-23.9.1.27.9-conservative	the Government may take advantage of the orange badge system .register disabled driver be give orange badge .it take a long time to get that system establish by the Government .that be a convenient vehicle which already exist .no bureaucracy be need .I propose that my right hon .friend the Leader of the House draw to the attention of my right hon .friend the Secretary of State for Energy and the Minister of Transport the need for advice to be give to petrol company , wholesaler and retailer .
21984-1979-05-25.7.1.4.9-conservative	the hon .Gentleman have argue forcefully that this arrangement be illogical and wasteful and that it put a great strain on local finance because three separate bureaucracy have to be support by his 110,000 constituent .
21984-1979-05-25.7.1.4.11-conservative	let I say first of all that I do not agree that , prima facie , an organisational case can be make out for cut the three local authority down to one .but that be not the whole story .I question the argument that a reduction in the bureaucracy could of itself go a long way towards solve the Isle of Wight 's resource problem .the saving would simply be insufficient to make a real dent in it .
19401-1979-05-25.9.1.11.6-conservative	in our manifesto we say : it it not our intention to reduce spending on the Health Service ; indeed , we intend to make well use of what resource be available .so we will simplify and decentralise the service and cut back bureaucracy .over and over again during the election , we be tell that Conservatives would cut spending on health .that be not true .it be totally false , but it be use in the election to try to discredit we .we wish to raise , not low , standard in health care .we be pledge to a National Health Service available to everybody who wish to use it — at the time of need and irrespective of their financial position .
19401-1979-05-25.9.1.11.9-conservative	so we see the need to restore great professional freedom so that skill can once again be use without a mass of bureaucracy interfere .we should like to see nurse and other staff much more able to practise their skill in the way they be train to do .
10565-1979-05-25.10.1.3.7-conservative	the advent of council housing on an enormous scale have bring with it a new type of bureaucracy .planner , adviser , architect , a plethora of civil servant , maintenance man and inspector be all employ in the public sector .they have be responsible for the building , yet the building have become bad and tenant have become more miserable .regardless of the shape or size , and regardless of whether they be low or high density , the cost yardstick , or Parker Morris standard , have be apply .we now have more dissatisfied people live in unit of public housing than any other european country .that be why the Conservatives make council housing a central issue in the election campaign and why we shall sell as many house as we can to sit tenant in the hope that that will start to create change .
21726-1979-06-11.8.1.33.2-conservative	if my hon .friend find the difficulty and unevenness persisting , I urge he , or the specific garage , to get in touch with their supplier , to try other supplier if that be not satisfactory or to come to the Department of Energy and we shall sort it out .that seem to I a sensible way of handle the matter .I can not see that that be a reason for issue a mass of national Government priority — I know that my hon .friend be not suggest that , but other be — and saddle the country with a gigantic apparatus .I do not know what the love of Opposition Members be for this type of bureaucracy .it cost a great deal of money .
17487-1979-06-11.12.1.34.14-conservative	I spend a good part of the recess read again and again the argument on this issue .I do not take the simplistic view that large organisation , and the bureaucracy that go with they be always wrong .member of Parliament will know that from time to time bureaucracy can gather momentum and build up an ethic all of their own which may run contrary to the aspiration that they purport to represent and the people whom they purport to serve .in this case , I find that the argument be finely balanced .
21734-1979-06-12.19.1.20.7-conservative	although I welcome my right hon .and learn Friend 's strategy , I welcome some of the specific measure rather less than other .I be sorry that he feel it necessary to make the vat rate quite as high as 15 per cent . , although I strongly welcome the unification of the rate .it always seem to I to be absurd to have two different rate , cause excessive complication to those run business as well as encourage bureaucracy .the fact that we be now revert to one rate only will , to my way of thinking , be a great advantage to industry and commerce .
22154-1979-06-12.20.1.12.6-labour	also challenge be the need for a new commission .it argue that the New Towns Commission , which be sit and have be sit for a long time , be run out of work and that it could pick up another brief .it be argue that it be not necessary to establish a fresh bureaucracy to undertake the work .I hope that the GLC will consider whether it be necessary to establish such a commission .
21956-1979-06-12.20.1.59.8-labour	I accept what other of my hon .friend have say about mobility .I understand that the problem of transfer from one part of London to another have be make easy by the operation of the GLC 's housing scheme .on the other hand , I notice that there be to be a mobility scheme attach to the transfer of GLC housing .I understand that the scheme will require between 20 per cent .and 50 per cent .of the net vacancy in transfer property to be reallocate by the GLC to other needy borough in London .no doubt the aim be laudable , but the thought of two borough and the GLC be involve in the exercise make I wonder how much bureaucracy will be entail and how long it will take someone to get a transfer from , for example , Hackney to Greenwich when so much red tape be involve , with three local authority handle the operation .
10171-1979-06-12.20.1.69.7-labour	I have gallop through my speech to enable the hon .member for Streatham to reply .I shall not go into the highway and byway raise by the Under - Secretary of State , but he say that people in London be perfectly happy with the GLC .in the immortal word of the Duke of Wellington : if you believe that , you will believe anything .the GLC have rightly be describe as the slow bureaucracy this side of the Kremlin , and the soon it be abolish the well .
16394-1979-06-14.12.1.62.7-ulster_popular_unionist	but if the Government go ahead with the cut in the housing allocation for Northern Ireland , the Province will probably have to wait for up to 20 year to bring housing into line with the rest of the country .therefore I ask the Government to think again about the cut that they intend to impose on Northern Ireland .certainly let they reduce the cost of the bureaucracy in the Housing Executive , Enterprise Ulster and elsewhere , but let they not allow the Ulster people to suffer .
18622-1979-06-18.15.1.13.1-conservative	no , it be not as a result of political motivation , but the right hon .Member for Leeds , East , in the speech which I describe as wildly exaggerated , list a whole series of commodity which have go up in price — for example , milk — which be never in the province of the Price Commission anyway .that be a perfect example of a price increase hold back by the then Government , although it be need in order to meet the wage rise in the milk distribution trade , which have to be finance .a whole series of increase of that kind be hold up by the Labour Government pende the general election .I be certainly not charge the individual member of the Price Commission , and I would not do so .my criticism be of the policy of the right hon .member for Sparkbrook and of the very great problem of bureaucracy that it create for the country and for british industry .
22575-1979-06-18.15.1.76.8-conservative	our decline as an industrial Power can not and must not continue .a sick man be never cure by bleed he with leech even in the Dark Ages .an ail economy will not revive when it have to bear the burden of high and high taxation and more and more bureaucracy .
19206-1979-06-18.16.1.14.6-labour	a community recommendation be really all that be necessary , and I would have think that that be what the Minister must go for .there also seem little point in the Commission duplicate the international work already take place .again , as the hon .Gentleman know , the NWC be a member of the European Association of Water Authorities , which have agree to press the Commission and member government to exclude the specification of standard method from the directive .the expert be on our side and not on the Minister 's .they do not believe that it be necessary to deal with water sampling and analysis through the sledgehammer of an EEC directive .what be the reason give by the Commission ?it propose to enact this legislation under Article 100 and 235 of the Treaty .article 100 say whereas any disparity between the provision already applicable or in preparation in the various Member States concern method of measurement and the frequency of sampling and analysis for each parameter to determine the quality of surface water may create unequal condition of competition , one of the reason the Commision give for this directive be that difference in the method of water sampling may create unequal condition of competition .how stupid can we get ?how absurd can these regulation and directive become ?we have a Government , whom I do not especially criticise , although I disagree with they , who have declare war on bureaucracy .in the Budget , they have declare war on local government and their own civil service because they believe that too many official be run around with bit of paper .
19206-1979-06-18.16.1.14.7-labour	the Government be plan to reduce the number of staff in our Civil Service and our local government service .yet they countenance this nonsensical directive , draw up by little bureaucrat run around in Brussels , with apparent equanimity .it be true that Brussels civil servant get pay a lot more than our and that saving would be beneficial , but the Government be prepared to countenance the bureaucracy that have draw up this directive .that be why we believe that our amendment be appropriate and should be support by the whole House of Commons .
16389-1979-06-18.16.1.34.7-labour	let the Minister accept the amendment .concern about the document have be express from both side of the House .hon .member be worried about the burgeon growth of bureaucracy .we do not want these absurd harmonisation proposal , range from the analysis of drinking water to the noise of lawn mower .no one in his right mind can want to see it extend .we want to see it diminish .
16389-1979-06-18.16.1.34.10-labour	if hon .member be concerned to see some diminution of bureaucracy , they should accept the amendment .if hon .member be also concerned about the encroachment of the Commission on the power of this Parliament , that also be a valid point of view , and they too should endorse the amendment .
19206-1979-06-18.16.1.36.1-labour	I be not declare war on Europe at all .that be the last thing that I would want to do .I do not want to declare war on anyone .what I be do be declare war on european bureaucracy , and I hope that the hon .Gentleman and every other hon .member would support I in that .
17154-1979-06-19.9.1.35.1-labour	I beg to move , as an amendment , to leave out from ' aircraft ' to the end of the Question and to add instead thereof : ' but , whilst agree with the international standard suggest by the International Civil Aviation Organisation , believe that they be well achieve through that body ; regard extension of EEC competence in the field of aviation as undesirable ; and deplore the duplication of exist machinery and the creation of additional bureaucracy . ' .there be no dispute about the need to control aircraft noise .this debate rellate solely to the question whether this directive be the right method .I would like to make one preliminary observation on the draft directive .as the explanatory memorandum make clear , acceptance of the draft directive would severely restrict the freedom of this country to operate an international agreement that be enter into .we would not be able to introduce domestic legislation in future on these matter unless the EEC have first agree that we could do so , even though we have be a member of the international organisation concern and have agree to do so there .there can be no dispute about this matter .it be contain in the Government 's explanatory memorandum .
10636-1979-06-19.9.1.47.2-conservative	I do not welcome the last phrase in the amendment , which deplore the duplication of exist machinery and the creation of additional bureaucracy .over the past few year there have be a welcome move towards a more effective european approach to civil air transport .for example , the Association of European Aircraft Constructors have be seek joint airworthiness requirement .it would be well for we all if there be an effective counterweight in Europe to the FAA .that be why I intervene in my hon .friend 's speech .at present it be exceedingly expensive to sell an aeroplane from one Community country to another .if it be wish , for example , to sell an aircraft from Britain to France or Germany it have to be validate by the individual airworthiness body of the buying country .that be an impediment to trade , and business suffer .
22561-1979-06-19.9.1.59.2-labour	have reflect on the work that we have do in these international body , I think that it be clear that it would be undesirable that we should have a plethora of organisation , each attempt to achieve the same goal .I do not think that that would be conducive to the attainment of the objective that I have set out .it be not helpful to have an unnecessary bureaucracy .it be not right that airline should be subject to additional and often unnecessary form filling and inquiry be make to no real purpose .
22561-1979-06-19.9.1.59.8-labour	the hon .Gentleman retail the benefit that might accrue from the adoption of the draft directive , but he do not deal satisfactorily with the possible disadvantage .be there not a risk that all that will be achieve be a large bureaucracy , more researcher and other people be employ , more office be occupy and more questionnaire , all demand the deployment of more resource to achieve marginal benefit ?
22561-1979-06-19.9.1.59.9-labour	the Conservative Party be scathing about bureaucracy in this country , even when it be the author , as in the case of the Health Service and local government , but its silence be deafen when it come to increase bureaucracy in the EEC .far , the Conservative Party be prepared to aid and abet it .
19270-1979-06-19.9.1.61.2-conservative	I refer first to the amendment move by the hon .Member for Waltham Forest ( Mr. Deakins ) .I should at once put he and his hon .friend the Member for Hackney , Central right over this question of what the amendment refer to as the duplication of exist machinery and the creation of additional bureaucracy .I be not sure , even now , that either of the hon .member have quite grasp the point .that must be my fault in not explain it adequately .this directive do not create additional bureaucracy or machinery — beyond the machinery and bureaucracy require for the member of the Community to receive from the Community a letter — presumably frank with a 9p stamp , or whatever it cost in Brussels — tell they that they be require to implement the standard of ICAO which be already in existence .
10212-1979-06-20.3.2.2.1-conservative	yes , Sir .I attach great importance to our manifesto commitment to relax the licensing system now administer by the traffic commissioner in order to enable new bus and other service to develop and to encourage new private operator .our aim will be to increase choice , save resource — particularly energy — and remove unnecessary bureaucracy .
18050-1979-06-20.8.1.50.11-conservative	much be make during the passage of the Bill , and in the subsequent referendum campaign , of the extra layer of government , the additional bureaucracy , the extra cost , the arbitrary division of power , the potential for conflict with Westminster , the expectation in the industrial and economic field which would be raise but which could not be fulfil , the danger inherent in the funding arrangement and the consequent threat to local rate , and the weakening of Scotland 's voice and possibly her number of representative here .I be sure that all these argument be valid and important , but to my mind the single overriding reason for repeal the Act now be that it be inherently flawed .
22540-1979-06-20.8.1.99.1-labour	I think that my hon .friend put his case differently .I would not be in favour of start up economic agency before there be any political control over they .once they be put into operation they become part of the bureaucracy .the very people that man they start to fight against political control .
10010-1979-06-20.8.1.101.11-conservative	the Scotland Act would merely have create a new Executive and , perhaps more frightening , a new and increase bureaucracy .it would have create new source of unaccountable patronage , legislation and restraint .all the thing that I be give to understand that it be set out to avoid would have be achieve .
10010-1979-06-20.8.1.101.12-conservative	"""during the referendum campaign I be amazed to hear many """" yes """" campaigner tell the people of Scotland that have minister sit in Scotland would control bureaucracy and make the Executive more accountable .it be a total misapprehension of politic to believe that Ministers can call executive to account .by their very nature , minister be part of those Executives , and it require the elect representative of the people , outside the Executives , to be able to exercise control over they ."""
10010-1979-06-20.8.1.101.13-conservative	instead of less centralised government be create by the Scotland Act , we be be offer another tier of the same .instead of more accountability , we be be give an executive Assembly with even great sway .instead of less bureaucracy , we be be offer a system with an inbuilt potential for increase bureacracy in Scotland to a very large degree .
22520-1979-06-20.8.1.105.4-labour	the Secretary of State , when he be an Under - Secretary in the Scottish Office , be responsible for pilot the reform of local government in 1973 .he set up the great bureaucracy that Scotland have ever see .he be present at that birth .he be responsible , in one fell swoop , for reduce by 50 per cent .the number of elect local councillor and for double the number of bureaucrat .he be responsible for a 100 per cent .increase in bureaucracy and a 50 per cent .decrease in democracy .it be no surprise that the midwife should now act as the undertaker to what would have be a worthwhile extension of democracy in the Scotland Act .it be sad to behold .
22496-1979-06-20.10.1.6.8-conservative	those hurdle be the role of legislation , the role of regulation and the burden of bureaucracy face those who seek to start a business , whether they be the problem of planning consent at the beginning or of employment legislation later on .the Secretary of State for Employment announce that he propose to amend two provision of the Employment Protection Act in advance of any measure contain in his further review of the legislation .those two measure , to lengthen the qualifying period for unfair dismissal and reduce the period of notice for small redundancy , will benefit small business .the Budget make a dramatic change in the incentive to people to start and expand business , and in so do to create wealth for themselves and job for the district in which they be carry on their activity , and to broaden the tax base , so create wealth for the whole of the community .
10647-1979-06-21.11.1.36.1-conservative	be my right hon .friend aware that his statement this afternoon be both deplorable and disgraceful to many member on both side of the House ?will he take seriously the request make , in a moderate and responsible fashion , by the right hon .Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition and reconsider the proposal that have be put to the House this afternoon ?will he also give an assurance that there will be a free vote in this House on the subject , include Ministers , so that the House can come to a proper decision ?furthermore , will he say how hon .member be to be able to contain and manage the bureaucracy if the people who comprise it be give much well facility and far high salary than member of this House ?
16469-1979-06-21.13.1.17.8-liberal_democrats	we should embark on way of resuscitate the economy .instead of create quango like the MSC as we do in 1973 , expand bureaucracy , come close to set up alternative education system and get into competition with already bureaucracy - fill local govenment , it would be far well to return the function of the MSC to local government and let it get on with the job .the Association of Metropolitan Authorities propose that action a few day ago .we would do well to listen to it .
22249-1979-06-25.8.1.113.6-labour	because of the Government 's determination to cut bureaucracy and to reduce or freeze recruitment to the Civil Service , there be no likelihood of the Government give the Committees the number of staff require .
22010-1979-06-25.8.1.139.4-conservative	this change be not revolutionary in the way that some hon .member , such as the hon .Member for Fife , Central ( Mr. Hamilton ) , have be say that a great counter - bureaucracy would be build up , something on american line .I do not see that happen at all .I believe that the American Congress have some 40,000 civil servant and bureaucrat service it , a sort of counter - government .that be not envisage in the proposal before we , nor do I believe that it will happen .the new Select Committees will be allow to appoint adviser and staff as they see fit , but that will not be a form of counter - bureaucracy .
17238-1979-06-25.8.1.182.8-labour	I welcome the strike development that have take place during the last three year , notably under the impetus of the work of the Select Committee of my hon .friend the Member for Feltham and Heston ( Mr. Kerr ) .I worry about those who show no readiness to be a part of this work or who , on certain occasion , have not be prepare to support it on the Floor of the House .I gather from some hon .member who participate in the February debate as well as today 's , but especially in February , that there be a little cynicism abroad about the possible attendance of Ministers .there be a fear that this will inject consensus politic into our proceeding on the Floor of the House and that it may lead to a proliferation of parliamentary bureaucracy .
17238-1979-06-25.8.1.182.14-labour	another major fear be of the possible proliferation of parliamentary bureaucracy .a contrast be draw with the United States .I hope that that argument will not be overdone , not only because I be an admirer of american institution , and especially of investigative work on Capitol Hill , but because this development may be see by historian as part of a secular metamorphosis over the last 15 year since 1964 and the new intake of hon .member .I hope that conservative Members will not mind my claim credit for many of my hon .friend who come into Parliament in that year and be dishearten by what they take to be the opportunity open to they , but be simultaneously inspire by what they believe be happen in Washington , and especially in the Committee on Foreign Relations under the chairmanship of Senator Fulbright .
10327-1979-06-25.8.1.188.9-labour	it be also inevitable — I do not make this statement imply that in any way it be corrupt — that close personal relationship will , develop as well .let I say to those of my Labour colleague who have voice suspicion of the role of the Civil Service in government that this will suit civil servant very well indeed .they thrive on the back - door relationship and on beguile their critic at lunch or elsewhere , and they be well equipped , because they be exceptionally skilful operator , to manipulate .that be the case , I believe that this system — in which there will be a close relationship for the first time between hon .member and the civil servant of a specific Department — will be bad for Parliament , because Parliament should operate at arm 's length from the bureaucracy .
10327-1979-06-25.8.1.188.10-labour	my right hon .friend the Member for Bristol , South - East say that he regard the proposal make by the Leader of the House as a victory for Parliament .I could not disagree with he more and , know his view on the way in which we should seek to disentangle ourselves from the bureaucracy , I be surprised that he take that view .
17986-1979-06-25.8.1.206.10-labour	that be not because we be nice fellow or because we wash behind our ear .it be because the chairman , with all of whom a wholly arm - length relationship have be maintain , come not only to respect we and to realise that , as investigator , we be pretty tough but straight , fair and incorruptible but to realise that , far from be a latter - day version of the Spanish Inquisition , our prestige and experience could be invoke on their side when the Government or bureaucracy overstep the mark and democracy have to rush to the rescue .
10427-1979-06-25.8.1.222.6-labour	of course , in one sense the development of in - house skill of this kind be a very good thing , but it raise a number of important and so far unanswered question about the political balance of power between the State bureaucracy on the one hand and elect Ministers on the other .official hold the power of the drafter and too often draft paper without consultation with the Minister .by the time a Minister receive the paper , it be virtually impossible for he to unpick an agree Whitehall package .as Dick Crossman say in his memoir , I have yet to see a Minister prevail against an interdepartmental official paper without the backing of the Prime Minister , the First Secretary or the Chancellor .another factor which undermine the political accountability of the Civil Service be the expertise of official in employ the Whitehall network .as we know from experience , this involve such interesting device as official contact opposite number in other Whitehall Departments to enable they to brief their Ministers against their own Minister , where the latter have take a line which may be outside the broad Whitehall consensus .that , I submit , be the context for a real debate about the nature of executive power and what be require to regulate it .the re - establishment of genuine democratic control over the bureaucracy demand many reform .I think that the setting up of these departmentally relate Select Committees be an important one , but it certainly be not enough .

22517-1979-06-26.10.1.76.8-liberal_democrats	there be also a definite feeling that government be far too remote from the people , that Welsh elector have no say in their future , and that we be be govern by a faceless bureaucracy in Whitehall over which we have little control .I be sure that people who hold those belief will not find a House of Commons Committee an adequate answer to their criticism .we need to examine the whole question seriously and formulate a positive approach .
10635-1979-06-26.10.1.86.6-plaid_cymru	it be argue that an Assembly would lead to too much bureaucracy , but , as the unemployed in Cardiff know , 1,100 job would have be create by the Assembly .we do not hear much about bureaucracy in the run - up to the european election .the European Parliament create an extra tier of Government and only 33 per cent .of the people vote for member of that Assembly , but the Government go ahead with it .there be a duality of standard between what be acceptable for Wales and what be acceptable in more favour arena .
22158-1979-06-27.3.3.5.1-labour	despite these amicable discussion which be now take place , will the Minister agree that there be a case for state that a duplication of function and an overlapping of bureaucracy exist between these two body ?bear in mind the need to channel more money directly into sport , will he reconsider the possibility of hold an official inquiry into this issue ?
18487-1979-06-27.3.3.6.1-conservative	it be not my intention to hold a full inquiry .that would set up even more bureaucracy .I believe that the chairman of the Sports Council and the CCPR , and their colleague , under my chairmanship , can resolve the difficulty at our meeting , and there be no need to have a special inquiry .

21715-1979-07-17.14.1.65.1-conservative	that be not hypocrisy .the system must be bring back to serve the public and bureaucracy which perpetuate itself must be end .that be the sort of bureaucracy which soak up nurse who want to be nurse and turn they into administrator so that they can not care for patient .doctor be allow to build up small empire — for example , the x - ray evaluation unit at king College Hospital on which about £ 500,000 be spend unnecessarily under the Labour Government .we want a Health Service that serve the public .we need to increase productivity , to get nurse on the ward and out of office .the lawyer in the county council should be make to understand that when they be deal with voluntary body they should help they and not get in their way by insert daft clause in tenancy agreement to provide that the window will be wash every two month when the aim be to set up a home for mentally - handicapped adult .there must be some vision about the matter .it may be necessary to cut some of the cherish project of Labour member like the hon .member for Sheffield , Hillsborough ( Mr. Flannery ) , our teaching friend — to cut out some of the bad teaching .

16394-1979-07-23.11.1.15.7-ulster_popular_unionist	in a normal democratic society , the responsibility for public authority housing would be safely in the hand of elect councillor .but not so in Northern Ireland , where we have a kind of corporate State tailor - make for the bureaucracy , with every important facet of life , whether public or private , control , regulate and dominate by statutory board .
16394-1979-07-23.11.1.25.6-ulster_popular_unionist	I trust that the Government will immediately show that they want to put an end to bureaucracy and to restore democracy to the people in Northern Ireland , and not only to end the terrorism that have destroy and be destroy so many life but to give pride back to the people , and the ability to govern their own country .

10601-1979-07-24.9.1.50.1-conservative	with respect , I think that that intervention be completely irrelevant .the hon .Gentleman do not realise that small business want incentive and reduce taxation and not subsidy .the order be start to fulfil the second , commitment of release the hand of bureaucracy from small business .
10601-1979-07-24.9.1.54.3-conservative	I believe that there be a precedent , in that the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 do not apply to firm with few than six employee .I urge my hon .and learn friend earnestly to consider likewise exempt such small firm from the unfair dismissal provision of the Employment Protection Act .I be sure that if he do so he would be fulfil our election pledge to lift the dead hand of bureaucracy from small firm .
10342-1979-07-25.4.8.6.1-conservative	I be surprised that the hon .Gentleman should raise that point .the policy have be widely welcome by the association .it get rid of an unnecesssary piece of bureaucracy that be slow down the speed at which land disposal could take place and bring land into useful and effective use .

22561-1979-07-26.21.1.59.3-labour	one have to have an element of bureaucracy — in the sense of an administration — in get the partnership scheme off the ground .I feel that , underlie all this talk about attack bureaucracy and prune it , be a desire to assail the whole concept of the partnership scheme .perhaps this will not be a frontal assault .perhaps it will be a corrosive influence which will render the concept void over a period of time .time will tell .
18895-1979-07-27.3.15.2.13-conservative	I hope that we shall be able , without invoke any bureaucracy , to take similar step to ensure the proper registration of accommodation .this be require not only for hotel but for small boarding house , guest house and farm accommodation .it will enable tour operator to know what accommodation be avail- able .this can be do by precept through the local authority , which have a great part to play in ensure that people have the opportunity to advertise their service .
18895-1979-07-27.3.15.2.14-conservative	in return for such facility , I believe that those who own accommodation should mark up on the door of their premise the price which they charge so that that information will be generally know .I do not share the view that such a system will require a paraphernalia involve inspector .I believe that it can be undertake by local authority , in co - operation with local boarding house association and the BHRCA .I hope that everybody will play a part in seek a sensible system .if we operate the system in the right way , we shall enjoy all the facility that we find on visit overseas , without the necessity for the bureaucracy which be so often associate with control .link with this desire be the grow part to be play by local authority in promote tourism .
19270-1979-07-27.3.15.4.12-conservative	there be a good case for registration of accommodation , but it must be voluntary .we should not attempt to take power , and then enforcement power , with a further bureaucracy and inspectorate devote to chase landlady around because they have not register their accommodation .I shall not comment on other reason , although I can hear some muttering in the Chamber .
18622-1979-10-22.4.3.9.1-conservative	as the former Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection say , the Price Commission be never intend to be an agency for hold down the retail price index .I believe that the Price Commission lead to enormous bureaucracy for british industry and have virtually no impact on price .there be no question of revive it .
21954-1979-10-22.11.1.40.20-conservative	I have always fervently believe in the concept of wide share ownership — I be one of the founder member of the wide share ownership movement — but successive government have pay only lip service to that concept .wider share ownership would provide a valuable bulwark against the ever - encroach power of the State ; it would go beyond mere encouragement of commercial activity and provide a bastion of freedom .we want great dissemination rather than concentration of ownership in the hand of the State or great institution .if that be to be attain , as the Minister of State rightly say , small investor who would engage in this activity must have confidence .they will not have confidence unless they be satisfied that the law , as it operate when they wish to invest their saving , be adequate to protect they .that be why the Government be right to insist upon the tight control of public company and great disclosure and revelation of information by large company to the broad mass of people who may become investor in and owner of those company but at the same time to liberate the important small sector , which be utterly different , from the shackle restraint and bureaucracy which be at present impose upon it .
10223-1979-10-22.11.1.44.3-labour	it be ironic that a country such as the United States of America , the citadel of free enterprise , be far more regulated , when it come to industry , than a country supposedly strangle by socialist bureaucracy .if one go to America and look at the various State regulatory commission , one see how they regulate the security industry , mortician , hairdresser , chiropodist , and how , they regulate not just the small boy but the big boy .listen to the argument of those who assume that the United States , because it be supposedly a free enterprise society , have weak law and regulation than the United Kingdom , be amusing .if we look not just at the Stock Exchange but at industry in general , in my view , we see that we have an obsession with self - regulation .somehow it be imagine that if we let the boy put their own house in order that be superior to public involvement .
10504-1979-10-22.11.1.70.14-labour	the major issue that will confront this country in the come year be that of industrial democracy .the Government now claim that they have no intention of legislate on the issue of supervisory board .yet we know that the EEC fifth draft directive on company law , which be presently work itself through the large bureaucracy of Brussels , will eventually oblige this Government , as it would any Government , to produce a legal framework for industrial democracy in this country .I do not share the optimism of the hon .member for Mid - Sussex about the capacity , wish or desire of british company to evolve their own system of industrial democracy and supervisory board that will cope with the demand that will eventually be impose upon we by the EEC .the EEC will try to impose uniform structure and system that apparently work extremely well for the other country in the European Community which be compete successfully against we in many world market .
18622-1979-10-23.13.1.23.2-conservative	I turn to the abolition of the Price Commission .I should tell the hon .member for Norwood that it be no use search in our policy for a modify system of price control ; it do not exist .nor do the pre - notification of price and the associated paraphernalia of a great bureaucracy which employ over 500 person and which would have cost nearly £ 8 million this year and lead to countless burden on british industry and commerce .for what purpose do it exist in the past ?the right hon .member for Birmingham , Sparkbrook ( Mr. Hattersley ) assure we that the Price Commission be not an agency for hold down the rpi .indeed , its power be limit to defer price increase and it perform that role successfully and visibly — not for political purpose — in the period lead up to the election .

19169-1980-01-14.13.1.84.6-conservative	"""the third reason why I be in favour of the Bill be that it will , at least , help to roll back the ever - rise tide of bureaucracy .outside the House , everybody believe that we have far too many bureaucrat — so we do .too many of they be engage in local government .however , it be not just the number of bureaucrat to which objection be take but their power .bureaucrat in local government can say to tenant """" no , you can not paint your door this colour """" or """" you must leave the house that you have live in for 40 year because we have decide that you be no long a suitable tenant to live here ."""" in that way , a couple who have live in a house for 30 or 40 year may be force to move .tenant be also tell that they can not have dog because that be what the bureaucrat have decide .that sort of petty interference will be wipe away to a great extent by the Bill .it will roll back the tide of bureaucracy .not only that , but the Bill will mean that few bureaucrat will be need for the administration of council estate .there will be less need for repair man , and so on , and , at the end of the day , that will help to cut rate rise .there will be less burden on local authority and less need for the present level of finance ."""
19169-1980-01-14.13.1.84.11-conservative	because I believe that the Bill increase freedom of choice , because it will see a massive redistribution of wealth within Scotland , because it roll back bureaucracy and because it enable council management to concentrate on those who need help , it be a welcome Bill .conservative member do not deny the great difficulty that there will be in the matter , but , on the balance of argument and justice , I fully support the Bill .
10276-1980-01-15.12.1.38.3-conservative	I commend this Bill to this House with pride because it be far more than just another housing Bill .it will transform the personal prospect of million of our citizen , offer to turn they at their wish from tenant to owner .it will establish their right as individiual above the bureaucracy of the State .it will come to be see among the fine tradition and philosophy of the Conservative Party .
10327-1980-01-15.12.1.108.4-labour	the problem be that the Secretary of State be a great fighter when word be his weapon .but , sadly , in his crusade he seem to be lead an army of conscientious objector .let we be fair to the Secretary of State .he be fight so many crusade at once that he can not win they all immediately .as we know , another of his battle be against bureaucracy .he spell out his view vividly in a speech that he make in Cheltenham in July .it be a major oration and at time his language reach demosthenic height .take this extract , which I quote in its entirety : sale of council house .get on with it .but it be on the subject of bureaucracy that the Secretary of State be at his most eloquent .he say : we be now at a point where the web of bureaucracy be too dense , too pervasive , and entangle far more than it ought … local council … do not need , they do not want , the fussy supervision of detail which now exist .let we look at the Housing Bill and see how in it the Secretary of State get rid of the web of bureaucracy and the fussy supervision of detail .let we consider , in particular , how a council tenant go about exercise his right to buy a house .it be a simple straightforward procedure .first , the tenant serve a write notice on the council under clause 5(1 ) .the council respond by serve a notice on the tenant under clause 5(1 ) .for good measure , the council then serve a further notice on the tenant under clause 10(1 ) .then , not rest on its laurel , the council send the tenant a form under clause 10(3 ) .the tenant have be leave out of thing a bit , so he counter smartly by serve another write notice on the council under clause 11(1 ) .
10327-1980-01-15.12.1.108.8-labour	along the way , the House will be relieve to hear , the Secretary of State have all sort of little job to do .he may make an order under clause 7(3 ) , or regulation under clause 9(4 ) , or order under clause 17(1 ) and clause 20(2 ) , or regulation under clause 21(1 ) , or a determination under clause 22(7 ) , or an order under clause 25(1 ) .that be how the Bill make it easy for the council tenant to buy his house and how the Secretary of State fulfil his promise to get rid of fussy supervision of detail and to destroy the web of bureaucracy .

17605-1980-02-20.10.1.35.7-liberal	a good deal of management be virtually a bureaucracy .it move from place to place .it be not interested in the community .co - operative will not mean that worker will run the business or manage it , but they will have a say in appoint the management , and have continual interest in how it perform .increasingly , worker be want to be treat more as owner than as mere hand .it would be sensible to make some part of nationalise industry into co - operative .it would be sensible to encourage worker to put redundancy payment into their own business .some be willing to do that .it would be sensible to give MG car , for instance , to the worker , and to give other part of the nationalise industry back to the people who work in and depend upon they .such a development would be peculiarly appropriate to Scotland , which have a long tradition of a more widespread democracy than England .
10010-1980-02-20.10.1.46.2-conservative	it be fascinating that we never hear from the hon .gentleman or from councillor in Edinburgh who be promote the rate increase of intention to cut back on administration , bureaucracy or waste .that be where saving can be make .
19438-1980-02-22.4.5.3.2-conservative	as I count myself among those who believe that politician be too ready to govern human activity with more and more bureaucracy , it may be a little surprising that I should seek to impose upon the Minister of Transport a duty to produce yet more piece of paper .however , I hope that I shall be able to show that in seek to put the Bill on the statute book its sponsor be embark upon new ground which make my additional requirement modest .I go far — the new clause be the least that might reasonably be expect .
10366-1980-02-25.3.3.3.1-conservative	I be grateful to my hon .friend for that reply .will he tell the House what have happen to the proposal for enterprise zone in which bureaucracy and red tape be to be cut to a minimum and the enterprise people be to be able to devote all their energy to be enterprise ?
10565-1980-02-25.8.1.4.10-conservative	there be little logic in any of the proposal .they have be dream up by a bureaucracy commit to create the maximum muddle .if they be implement , they must result in fray temper and heated argument as to what be applicable and where , on which train , and for whom .People will buy ticket to get they out of one region and into another .cyclist will struggle against the flow of rush - hour passenger and they will be discriminate against on the eastern region .British Rail have achieve in these proposal a guarantee for total confusion at some time and general confusion for the rest of the time .
22094-1980-02-26.12.26.17.7-conservative	I hope , therefore , that hon .member will recognise that our new company law advisory panel will provide the external advice that the Department need in a far more flexible way than would flow from some statutory quango , with , no doubt , a new bureaucracy and obligation to publish report .
10099-1980-02-27.4.21.5.1-conservative	do my right hon .friend agree that equally as important be the executive power give to the corporation to get on with the job and their ability to acquire surplus land from local authority and statutory undertaking with the minimum of bureaucracy ?

16472-1980-02-28.7.1.22.9-conservative	the duty of the pragmatist be to find out where public opinion be go .do public opinion require a deviation from what the former Chancellor of the Exchequer in his heart must know — and the present Chancellor advocate — be sound economic policy ?should the Chancellor deviate from they for reason of public opinion ?it be a matter of judgment .in my judgment , the Government be not ahead of public opinion and , if anything , I suspect that they be a little behind public opinion .I think that there would be support for even great cut , particularly in the bureaucracy — central and local .it have grow by 40 per cent .since 1972 .as far as I can judge , it have not give we anything like a 40 per cent .improvement in service as a result .
22012-1980-02-28.7.1.77.12-labour	no one can accuse the present french Prime Minister of be a softy .no one can say that the french bureaucracy be anything other than ruthless when the occasion require ruthlessness .yet , four year after the inception of the plan , the french face more or less the same rate of inflation as in 1976 and many of the same problem .
19169-1980-03-04.7.1.4.5-conservative	at this stage I do not want to go through all the argument that arise naturally out of what the hon .gentleman propose .a strong argument against a Convention lead to an Assembly be the fact that it would lead to more government when we want less and to more bureaucracy when we want less , and therefore to more expenditure and taxation , when we all want less taxation and expenditure , especially on bureaucrat .
22082-1980-03-04.8.1.67.7-labour	that be not to belittle the service of the Library , but they be general and can not be individual .we know for a fact , from all our work experience , that the kind of work we be do here — as member of the Select Committees and provide a constituency service back home , particularly if we attempt to do the job full - time — inevitably entail a variety of work which need research assistance .in our constituency we have become ombudsman of the last resort .we have become trouble - shooter for a variety of local challenge to bureaucracy , both national and local .some of those matter have to be follow through .if they be to be follow through diligently by a person act on behalf of the Member , that person could be a full - time research assistant .
10223-1980-03-04.8.1.88.9-labour	how can we do our job on Select Committees if the staff be generally part - time ?for example , on the Defence Select Committee there be three part - time adviser .they be dedicated , experienced people , but they be not full - time .in addition , we have general staff support .when that be set against the weight , experience , duplicity , secrecy and machination of the bureaucracy , it will be see that it be an extremely unequal task .
22348-1980-03-06.5.9.33.1-conservative	far to the point make by my hon .friend the Member for Coventry , South - West ( Mr. Butcher ) , will my right hon .friend take time today to study the survey into expenditure by local authority commission by Sir Frank Marshall on behalf of the Conservative Party ?be my right hon .friend aware of the knowledge that have be manifest through that survey that , while local authority have be cut service , they have not be cut manpower to the same degree ?will my right hon .friend continue to impress on local authority that it be essential that service be maintain and bureaucracy cut wherever possible ?
19284-1980-03-06.5.9.34.1-conservative	I have see that survey and I agree that it reveal a disappointing state of affair .it be all too easy for some local authority to cut sensitive service , when they should be cut the number employ in the administrative bureaucracy .I endorse everything that my hon .friend say .
10631-1980-03-07.7.1.61.2-conservative	I should like to put my misgiving to the House .they involve important point of principle that go beyond the important Bill we be discuss .if a mechanism for monitoring be set up , it will create an additional layer of bureaucracy , paperwork and form fill to an already overstrain structure .someone would have to complete the report , collate they and file they , read they , submit they , digest they and distil they .this be what reporting be .this be what monitoring be .it involve scarce , expensive public manpower .
10631-1980-03-07.7.1.61.4-conservative	I be not a constitutional expert , but it law be make subject to regular review , I invite hon .member to consider what would be at stake .we pass too many law already , some of which be not as good as they might be .perhaps they all need to be monitor by a panoply of bureaucracy .that might act as a deterrent to the introduction of more legislation of this kind , but the statute book be already full of legislation .
17907-1980-03-10.8.1.35.5-conservative	I wish to draw attention to a number of resource which in my view be worthy of deep and more speedy consideration than develop a wholly new housing programme .cost have get totally out of hand .Bureaucracy have intercede , with argument between the Housing Corporation , the Department of the Environment and all the other body , result in a lengthening of the time necessary for the housing association movement to produce as many unit of accommodation as could be provide if that system be improve and if some of the bureaucracy be remove .
16415-1980-03-10.8.1.47.4-labour	I admit that I feel for the member of the Government Front Bench .they have a difficult job to do .they be give a very difficult job over the weekend by the right hon .member for Taunton ( Mr. du Cann ) , who have ask they to cut public expenditure even more but to do it in such a way that service be not cut .it have not dawn on the right hon .gentleman that one can not cut public expenditure in such sector as housing without affect service .it seem that right hon .and hon .member on the Government Benches want to cut bureaucracy rather than service , so that , for example , instead of reduce the council house building programme perhaps we should sack the rent collector who would collect the rent from the house when they be build .it seem that that be the sort of alternative that the Secretary of State have lay before he .
18469-1980-03-11.13.1.78.2-conservative	the old efficiency and the old compassion seem to have disappear .they have not disappear because people have become less compassionate , but they have become submerge by new bureaucracy and by sheer size and scale .
10631-1980-03-12.11.3.4.2-conservative	we have develop a parkinsonian position , which must happen in bureaucracy .it be a natural phenomenon against which we have to guard — not only the bureaucracy but the Ministers in charge of those bureaucracy .that be fortify by the particular phenomenon pertain in the Ministery of Overseas Development and other development ministry in other country .we suffer because we have such a good start with our ex - imperial administrator , who , unfortunately , steadily leave the scene .
10631-1980-03-12.11.3.4.5-conservative	I be sure that the manifestation of the excess this year be a repeat of the sort of thing that I begin to experience during the period 1973–1977 .development economist get exit about plan .they go to the recipient country and meet other development economist who have be to the same university — they have all be to Sussex university .they go to seminar at Harvard and they be very excited about plan big project and about state bureaucracy and patronage .that be the game that have develop .I hope that my hon .friend the Minister will tell I that it be on the decline , but it have be a phenomenon that have lead to the excess on the Supplementary Estimate .
22104-1980-03-12.11.9.1.21-scottish_national_party	I be not in favour of co - ordination purely for its own sake .co - ordination often involve we in create another tier of bureaucracy .I do not think that that be what Timbury envisage .there be a need to ensure effective liaison between a social work department and the health service .I have a pertinent example of the lack of such liaison only today .it be a personal matter and I shall not detain the House with it .it relate to an individual very close to I , who suffer , in my view , from dementia .
-1980-03-17.7.1.145.3-na	I make it clear to the right hon .member for Stafford and Stone ( Mr. Fraser ) that I be bitterly opposed to the russian invasion of Afghanistan .with all due respect to my right hon .friend the Member for Stepney and Poplar ( Mr.Shore ) , I declare publicly my view of the invasion before those on the Opposition Front Bench declare the Opposition 's view .I make it clear that I be opposed to it .I be opposed to it now .it be wrong .no one can accuse I at any time of be soft towards the bureaucracy that run the Soviet Union .
10038-1980-03-18.13.7.35.3-labour	the Government study the way in which they could save on administrative cost .it be amazing that the Rayner inquiry examine the way in which pension be pay out through the post office and consider the possibility of make small saving , which would have do a great deal of damage to the service provide to pensioner .it do not seem to spend much time consider the rest of the bureaucracy involve in the pay out of pension .it would have be much more useful for it to consider the way in which pension book be organise than the post office end .it cause a great deal of anxiety and worry to pensioner and offer little improvement to the service .
10010-1980-03-20.5.13.3.1-conservative	have my right hon .friend have time to read the disturbing report of the evidence give by the Civil Service Department to the Treasury Select Committee ?do she realise that , despite Government effort , the number of civil servant will rise by 3,000 in the next financial year ?do she not agree that that be totally unacceptable ?be there no way of control this bloated bureaucracy ?
22227-1980-03-20.5.15.9.1-conservative	we must , of course , produce more before we can spend more on the social service , include the Health Service .will not my right hon .friend agree that the Health Service be suffer from over - administration ?what can the Government do to cut down the huge bureaucracy in the Health Service , the size of which be to the detriment of various service to the public ?
19284-1980-03-20.5.15.10.1-conservative	as my hon .friend know , we be introduce legislation to reduce the administration by one layer , but I can not reinforce too strongly what he say .it be necessary to reduce bloated bureaucracy wherever it occur , whether in central Government , local government or public agency .we must vigorously pursue that policy .
18333-1980-03-20.9.1.50.7-conservative	an awful amount of paperwork be generate .the reason be that , unlike Britain , which be a democracy , the Community be a bureaucracy .it be a Eurocracy .it be run by bureaucrat with little democratic control .those bureaucrat devise scheme for the rest of Europe base on the low common denominator or the high common factor .I be not sure which apply .all the complex policy in all the country of Europe be put together in some super - complex policy and dished around Europe .in this House , late one evening , there will be an opportunity to take note .the fait accompli will take place later .this make people and many hon .member resentful of the way in which matter be progress within the European Community .
18333-1980-03-20.9.1.58.14-conservative	there be also the absurd problem of bureaucracy .these wretched measure from Europe come up for discussion in this House late at night .they impose problem and cost on our people , and because we sign a treaty at some time in the distant past we be force to push these regulation through the House .there be nothing that we can do about it .these problem must be take into account when we be renegotiate the CAP and the budget deficit .they must be weigh in the balance before we decide whether we proceed .
22346-1980-03-21.4.1.53.2-conservative	planning can have a negative effect upon rural life and service .get the economy move be the positive way of help rural community .planning and bureaucracy have a negative effect upon those community and their service .I see two strand of planning .the first seek to provide service for present and forecast population .that strand exercise a negative control on development .on the other hand planning can play a positive role in attempt to decide the future need of a particular area .I be concerned that too many authority be plan too rigidly for their area and in that context , many of they will become unstuck .
22595-1980-03-24.5.5.8.6-conservative	under the Bill , without new clause 6 , which I sincerely hope we shall not pass , we have for the first time innovatory legislation which allow entrepreneur to do just that .many of we have in our constituency entrepreneur who have already battle through the lengthy process of argue with the establish bureaucracy of the National Bus Company , the passenger transport executive and the local authority in order to get their service go .they be already provide service .in Committee I give three example from my own constituency where they be provide excellent service where the institutionalised public provision would just not succeed .I therefore urge the House to reject the new clause .
22070-1980-03-24.5.5.37.1-conservative	I understand the intention behind the new clause .I be not unsympathetic to it .do the right hon .Gentleman accept that the way in which it be phrase will give rise to an enormous number of application to the traffic commissioner , because a large number of route be subsidise ?for example , let we consider an express service between London and Manchester .for part of its journey it would run over part of the London Transport ordinary bus system .to refer that application to the traffic commissioner would create an enormous amount of bureaucracy and do nothing to help the freeing of public transport from bureaucratic interference , which many of we feel be necessary .
10488-1980-03-24.5.11.10.2-labour	there be probably a balance of judgment here , but our view be that without the display of such a disc the licensing system for bus will be less enforceable .that be apparently the Government 's view until the Committee stage .their argument for remove this provision be that the commissioner would have less clerical work and bureaucracy would be reduce .
10488-1980-03-24.5.11.10.13-labour	we be concerned — and I trust that the Parliamentary Secretary will address his mind to this — that if the duty to display a disc be not to be impose upon passenger service operator , that may mean that the Government will also remove that obligation from heavy good vehicle operator .what be the Government 's reason for not impose that duty on the passenger service operator ?some reason have be give in the report , and it be to those reason that we address our mind .Foster be concern only with minority , so that we be concerned here not with mass evasion but with create a system that can bring to order the minority who wish to break the law or disregard their obligation under operator licensing .any administrative system involve bureaucratic control , and safety administration require some form of bureaucracy .its extent must be a matter for judgment .
10488-1980-03-24.5.11.10.19-labour	"— [ official Report , Standing Committee H , 7 February , 1980 ; c.1280 . ]can the parliamentary Secretary say how that decision be reach ?presumably , when discussion start , the commissioner agree with it .the Minister must have have consultation with the commissioner and with the operator , who apparently wish to retain the disc system .what be the new insight ?surely it be not bureaucracy .that be clearly know before publication of the Bill .will the Parliamentary Secretary also confirm that the commissioner be prepared to abandon the disc system for bus but presumably to retain it for lorry ?"""
10488-1980-03-24.5.11.10.20-labour	I think that the balance of the argument both by Foster and by other concern be that the disc should be retain to help in enforcement .it would make it more difficult for the minority of cowboy operator to continue their practice .we must make a judgment on the balance between bureaucracy and the enforcement of standard .in our view , it would be well to maintain the disc as a helpful contributory factor , as in the road haulage industry , for the enforcement of both safety and other standard in the industry .
10115-1980-03-24.5.11.11.5-conservative	it seem to we that there be no sensible answer to that question , and the enforcement problem at which the requirement be aim be not such as to need the disc , and certainly not such as would justify the immense bureaucracy involve in issue thousand of they .
10115-1980-03-24.5.11.19.1-conservative	I be not blind myself to that possibility .we have to consider the possibility of that occur in practice .it be not inconceivable that there might be such an operator .ultimately , he will be detect , and the traffic commissioner will take appropriate action .the Opposition and the CPT suggest that operator should be issue with paper disc to be display on all vehicle that they operate every day of the week to guard against that eventuality .the bureaucracy , the time and the cost involve would be out of proportion to the risk involve .
17063-1980-03-24.5.11.20.1-labour	I shall not disappoint the Parliamentary Secretary , because what we be talk about be the cowboy operator .there be two question here .first , whose be the responsibility ?be it the responsibility of the policeman stop the bus , presume that the operator have his name and address and telephone number on the side ?what kind of bureaucracy be that ?but there be a more important question .there be a fundamental difference here .though I be not suggest for one minute that everyone do it , the man or woman board the bus can look at the disc and make sure that it be a licensed bus .under the Government 's system the potential passenger can not do that .
10115-1980-03-24.5.11.26.5-conservative	with respect , the Opposition , as their first amendment in Committee show , be just shy back to the tradition of have disc in bus , which we always have under the PSV system , which be no long require because of our new arrangement for annual inspection .they be now try to find new detail to put on new disc .I shall continue to consider the matter carefully .there be responsible body that be convince that somehow this be necessary .we have take many sounding on this matter and we continue to do so .it have not be establish to our satisfaction that there be a serious enforcement problem here which justify this quite out - of - proportion bureaucracy .in a Bill which be design to get rid of a great deal of the unnecessary bureaucracy and control in an area which have have far too much of it for year and year , it seem that we should concentrate on the essential .the Bill without the disc achieve the essential of have safe passenger vehicle on the road .
21646-1980-03-24.5.11.27.6-labour	we have already mention bureaucracy .however , another danger be that enforcement cost may become prohibitive .which of my hon .friend have a big enough police force in his constituency , suitably equip with car , to chase every vehicle that be simultaneously be run by a public service operator ?the police would need to contact each other by telephone in order to count and see whether the operator be in breach of his licensing condition .
10115-1980-03-25.12.1.9.3-conservative	I shall deal with the english aspect of excursion and tour and come to the cornish case later .generally , our argument be to save bureaucracy and needless objection by competitor when there be no particular interest in have licensing arrangement for they .
22579-1980-03-26.3.5.3.1-conservative	I thank my right hon .friend for that reply .however , in view of the Government 's state policy not only of reduce Government waste but simplify bureaucracy , how do he justify the continuance and extension of separate billing of the water rate ?
17853-1980-03-26.5.6.9.4-conservative	there be those who sometimes speak as if all our problem with public expenditure could be solve by reduce bureaucracy while leave subsidy and service untouched .the process of secure economy can not be as painless as that .it be easy to forget that the entire cost of the Civil Service represent only one - fifteenth of public expenditure .
22244-1980-03-27.4.11.4.1-conservative	I make it clear in the reply to my hon .friend the Member for Devon , North ( Mr. Speller ) that I do not believe that legislation , which would involve a great deal of bureaucracy and more police time , be justify in this case .I therefore believe it right to proceed by mean of a voluntary code on the safety of firearm with the various body concern .that I have do .those body have co - operate very willingly and be now produce those safety code .
19964-1980-03-27.10.1.1.26-labour	some of the cut be phoney , like the sale of asset ; some will not happen , like the cut in bureaucracy that the Government promise a year ago and of which we have illustration in Committee recently .some — this be more serious — be indiscriminate , because by hold cash limit at a level that accord to the Government 's figure will be at least 2 per cent .below the level of inflation and I guess will turn out to be 4 per cent .or 5 per cent .below the level of inflation , he will force all public authority — national , local , nationalise industry , the National Health Service , the lot — to make further spending cut if they take his advice .

22579-1980-03-27.10.1.105.8-conservative	I therefore beg my right hon .and learn Friend the Chancellor to impress upon his colleague in the Treasury and the Cabinet the urgent need to make further real cut in bureaucracy , to increase greatly the programme of denationalisation , if necessary by package profitable and unprofitable company into conglomerate to make they more attractive to sell off to the private sector , and to restore true democracy to the trade union for ordinary work man and woman , particularly in respect of the closed shop and secret ballot .
18709-1980-03-28.6.1.20.8-conservative	in recent year the GATT , the IMF and the World Bank have amply demonstrate their capacity to meet new change and challenge .this be a process that should and will continue .but we should aim to strengthen the exist system and not overturn it .I see no advantage in the proliferation of new international machinery or of the new international bureaucracy which would inevitably go with such machinery .

10601-1980-04-23.12.7.13.2-conservative	all of we on these Government Benches accept the need to encourage small firm , as it be to this sector of our business community that we have to look for the majority of the new job which must be create .there be two way by which we can encourage small firm .one be through taxation .we start on that in the Budget last year , and we do much more in the Budget this year .but the second and , I submit , most important way to help small firm be to reduce the burden of legislation and bureaucracy .
10601-1980-04-23.12.7.15.2-conservative	therefore , clause 7 be welcome , because it reduce the burden on small firm and it align the two - year qualifying period for redundancy with the two - year qualifying period for unfair dismissal .however , there be one problem .when one look at the clause in detail , it be clear that whoever draft it — I be sure that it be not one of my right hon .or hon .friend , but perhaps it be someone in the Department — have no experience of small business or small business man .if he have , he would never have include para - graphp ( c ) , which state : the dismiss employee be on be engage inform in writing of the effect of this section .that undermine the purpose of the clause — which be to relieve small business man of bureaucracy .small business man neither understand it , nor do they want to undertake the administration .the last thing that a small business man want be to get involve in paperwork .many will never have read the regulation , and in practice they will not give their employee notice of this part of the law in writing when they be first employ .many never get round to give contract of employment until they be challenge .I suggest that member of Parliament should consider their position as small employer .how many hon .member give their secretary contract of employment ?I trust that any hon .member who have not do so will be prepare to vote for this amendment tonight .

-1980-05-08.11.1.105.12-na	the key policy of this form of monetarism be to cut Government spending .I believe that that be correct in the present circumstance but , as I say , very painful .cut Government spending mean reduce Government subsidy and , therefore , the apparent cost of living will obviously rise .we must accept that , for the past two decade , we have be live well beyond our mean .a cut in Government spending also mean a cut in service , especially if Government and administrative bureaucracy be not cut in the early stage , which regrettably be still the case .
10631-1980-05-13.6.1.8.1-conservative	will my right hon .friend accept the view from one who have make a personal contribution to the reduction of bureaucracy that the reduction that she have in mind be at least attainable over the next four year ?I hope that we would do rather well .will my right hon .friend also accept that the fact that her Government have discover such a scope for reduction seriously call into question the contribution of the Civil Service Department over the year ?there be therefore a case for carefully consider whether that Department should be either make more efficient or abolish .
19284-1980-05-13.6.1.9.1-conservative	I do not believe that we can take all the reduction in bureaucracy into this House , which be the course that my hon .friend follow — and we be delighted to have he .with regard to the csd , we have to remember that for year the Civil Service have have a Government who load extra task on to it and who seem to we to encourage the retention of as many people as possible .we have a different approach , and we shall have the cooperation of the Civil Service Department in carry out that new approach .of that I be confident .

18679-1980-05-21.9.3.19.3-labour	we now see a deliberate move by the Government to shift people who be on national insurance benefit to supplementary benefit .the Government 's initial forecast be of 110,000 people be transfer to supplementary benefit , and , with that , the creation of 1,000 additional job in the Civil Service .so much for tackle administrative problem and bureaucracy .no doubt the Opposition will want to discuss in more detail the national insurance principle — that have be establish and accept , as of right , within our society — and the effect that the Bill will have on it .

10099-1980-05-23.7.1.1.17-conservative	I welcome the initiative that the Government propose to take with regard to enterprise zone .I applaud all these attempt to try to minimise the bureaucracy of the construction industry .compare with other country , however , we take too long between the concept of a development project and the actual construction start on site .I refer the Minister to a recent speech by Mr. Nigel Mobbs , chairman of Slough Estates , one of the lead development company , who be also president of the British Property Federation .the research carry out by his company be worth close examination .

10289-1980-06-02.17.5.7.7-conservative	the first be that the abolition of the 25 per cent .tax band will save bureaucracy .unfortunately , that claim be blow up almost immediately when the Inland Revenue witness appear before the Select Committee .the hon .Member for Enfield , North ( Mr. Eggar ) be nod his head , and he will know what happen .the Inland Revenue be compel to admit that the saving would be mainly on clerical staff .in other word , we be once again talk in term of the chief sack the indian , rather than of secure major saving of administrator .in addition , the saving be small and it be very difficult for a government who be at some stage , and before long , plan to introduce taxation of unemployment benefit to argue that they want to go very far down the road of save staff in the Inland Revenue .
10289-1980-06-02.17.5.7.8-conservative	in read that interesting evidence I note the passage where the Inland Revenue say that the Treasury be responsible for research into the effect of taxation , whereas the Treasury say that that task be the responsibility of the Inland Revenue .I hope that Treasury Ministers will note this curious disagreement .it be interesting that no one in either of these Departments be responsible directly and solely for this research .this be one area where there could be a small increase in bureaucracy , because this be a vital matter .the Chief Secretary say in relation to one tax increase that it be not important to look at the effect on ordinary people of increase in taxation .that be a deplorable attitude .the ignorance in this area should be rectify by any care Government .
22119-1980-06-04.4.9.3.1-conservative	do my right hon .friend agree that that demonstrate the outstanding popularity of the Government 's policy in sell public housing ?will he do everything in his power to ensure that those who wish to buy be not hold up by bureaucracy and socialist dogma ?

10342-1980-06-04.4.13.7.1-conservative	the first impression that we have , especially of the partnership authority when my right hon .and hon .friend become concerned with they , be of the excessive amount of bureaucracy and paper work involve in get action in these area .we have concentrate on get result with the minimum of bureaucracy and committee work .
19152-1980-06-04.6.3.85.2-labour	the Local Government , Planning and Land ( no .2 ) Bill appear in reprinted form yesterday .it contain over 13 page of the schedule on enterprise zone .the price which local authority be be ask to pay have hardly yet be mention .they will be ask by the Secretary of State for the Environment , both in informal conversation which have already begin and in the term of the schedule , to give up detailed planning control .the right hon .Member for Orkney and Shetland may think that that be a good thing , but exchange involve the Labour Benches so far have show that planning control have become a firm element in post - war government .in many place those who invest — this include pension fund represent large section of the population — require the protection that plan control give .it be a question not of bureaucracy but of wise decision about what sort of development should go where and how much of it there should be .we all know such centre .some of they be not far from this House , particularly town centre such as Croydon , where office developing have take place specifically as plan in a structure plan .
10152-1980-06-04.6.3.110.7-labour	my hon .friend the Member for Sheffield , Heeley ( Mr. Hooley ) ask about the Customs situation .I have envisage that that would not arise , but there will be endless bureaucracy to determine who be work in an enterprise zone and who be not .the question of distinguish , for tax and other purpose , which company be operate inside a zone and which be operate outside must be a complex matter .
10152-1980-06-04.6.3.114.5-labour	I come to one or two technical point .schedule 13 provide that a company may by notice in writing give to the inspector not later than two year after the end of the chargeable period for which the allowance fall to be make disclaim the initial allowance or require it to be reduce to a specify amount .can not a great deal happen in two year ?I think that it can .it seem to I that we be get into an enormously complicated area of bureaucracy , especially with this kind of time lag .
19152-1980-06-04.6.3.128.1-labour	the hon .gentleman misunderstood the point that I be make .I be not refer to the response to the invitation .I be concerned that planning control — and one man 's bureaucracy could be another man 's protection — should be take out of the hand of locally elect councillor in respect of planning application .if the scheme go through , the Minister will know that there be no planning application in the normal way in an enterprise zone .
22503-1980-06-04.8.1.26.4-conservative	it may be that my hon .friend will say that it would be a question of the intention of the manufacturer and the maker of the contract at the point where he let the good leave the plant or port in the United Kingdom .I agree with my hon .friend when he say that he do not want to set up an elaborate system of licence and do not want the bureaucracy and red tape that go with that .if he do not have that , however , how can he establish that good make in Bury St. Edmunds or Birmingham and send off to Ireland or some other third country , possibly Turkey , and then pick up by british vessel , be lawful ?in my view , this part of the order be a dog 's dinner .
18709-1980-06-04.9.1.41.15-conservative	the hon .member for Stockport , North ( Mr. Bennett ) ask how the sanction would operate .I touch on that in my opening remark .I say that we have consider carefully whether we should institute a system of licence .it would have be cumbersome , it would have involve a substantial increase in bureaucracy and it would have create a machine that might have be redundant before it be finish .we come to the conclusion that that would not be sensible .we decide instead that sanction should be operate on the basis of declaration by exporter that the good involve be not prohibit export under either of the order .firm will be require to enter detail of their export with Customs , together with a declaration before any good be ship .they will then be able to export their good .however , Customs have the power to go to their office and investigate their document to find out whether the basis of the declaration be truthful .it will be use that power .that be a well solution .Customs will check good as they leave , check the declaration and search the evidence .it will be up to the exporter to demonstrate that the declaration be base on a set of circumstance that justify make it .that be the way in which we shall administer the order .
-1980-06-05.9.1.57.11-na	I end on one doubt I wonder whether the hon .Member for Bedwellty be right .could we ever effectively have a system that differentiate between student in an individual country ?let I illustrate what I mean .do we honestly think that we could have a scheme that could , as it be , mean - test parent in Bangladesh ?we have only to reflect for a few minute on the enormous administrative problem in both Bangladesh and this country to see that that would be beyond our competence , without a gross bureaucracy .but if we could discriminate on foreign policy , on link with the Commonwealth and on other ground , that be something that I hope we would do .
19209-1980-06-09.3.13.5.1-conservative	be my hon .friend aware that some of my rougher friend in industry in the West Midlands ask why the Government can not set an example by cut down bureaucracy more quickly and control wage award , instead of get industry to do their dirty work for they ?

22557-1980-07-11.2.2.47.16-conservative	it be say that enterprise zone should be the subject of a major Government initiative in promote information technology in small firm .however , I must quarrel slightly with that proposal .enterprise zone be suggest in order to take the Government away from the planning activity of particular area .the experiment be be watch with great interest .enterprise zone be not only for small firm .they essentially involve a relaxation of control and a reduction of bureaucracy , and so on .one initiative — which have already be mention in connection with Docklands — be part of the PA Management Consultants ' scheme , under which a wire city would be lay out with the most modern telecommunication facility .it would be able to attract high technology company .I think that this project be know as Southwark Quays .it be not specifically link to an enterprise zone , although Docklands subsequently have be suggest as a suitable area .that be the kind of situation in which one may see the two concept come together .
18935-1980-07-15.37.1.10.5-conservative	the theory behind the concept of the enterprise zone be valuable , and it be one that I share .in many area industry and commerce need to be stimulate by the removal of what the Minister describe in Committee as a proliferation of control , regulation and requirement impose on industry and commerce in this country … as a result , government have be drive to a whole range of additional stimulus — incentive , subsidy , regional aid and various other measure to reinvigorate those sector .the Minister refer to the original idea , which be put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his speech on the Isle of Dogs .in Committee , my right hon .friend say : the simple concept that my right hon .and learn friend put forward be the alternative approach that if one could free industry and commerce from much of the bureaucracy and complication surround they , this might obviate the need for artificial stimulus , and industry could flourish in a climate more readily indentifie in certain other country .I agree with that concept , but I would not suggest that it should be limit to five or so area of a total of about 3,000 acre .
22251-1980-07-15.37.1.26.1-conservative	I could not disagree more with the hon .member .this be an important experiment , which could have application in relation to even great experiment by the Government for reduce the planning requirement and the tax burden on industry .but that be in no sense at the expense of the Government 's policy , over the period of a Parliament , of reduce the burden of bureaucracy and the burden of taxation , which be really the only way of get free enterprise and industry work on a large scale in this country once again .
21969-1980-07-18.2.2.25.6-conservative	therefore , when I argue , as I do , that this Government must take a much deep and wide look at the administration of Northern Ireland , I be not seek to do so out of a mere prejudice against bureaucracy , out of a desire to add to the total of civil servant dispense with .not at all .I do so because I be anxious to see that , within the national total available in accordance with the policy — which I support in principle — of the present government , more of the expenditure which go upon Northern Ireland can be usefully and not uselessly direct .
10507-1980-07-18.2.2.42.8-democratic_unionist_party	this bureaucratic approach to housing in Northern Ireland be adopt as a result of allegation by republican element against Loyalist politician .democracy be bury and the opinion of public representative be treat with total contempt .the housing shamble and the bureaucracy that produce it show that a speedy return to democracy be essential if peace and stability be to return to Northern Ireland even in housing .
22595-1980-07-21.8.1.126.3-conservative	it would be useful to lay a few myth about nationalise industry .have say that , I believe that we need a mixed economy , and I hope that hon .member will allow I to look at some aspect of it .nationalise industry seem inevitably to develop management structure which be complex , develop a cyclicly restrictive bureaucracy , which in the end be incapable of respond to outside stimulus and increasingly respond in a never - end cycle of cost against price to its own internal problem .
18386-1980-07-23.11.1.61.1-conservative	be my right hon .friend satisfy that the welcome move that he have announce really will lead to a reduction in bureaucracy within the Health Service ?be he aware of the widespread fear that the staff of the area health authority will be queue up to join the newly form district authority ?be he aware of the fear that the district authority might start operate more highly staff than be strictly necessary ?when my right hon .friend consider the composition of the community health council , will he take into account the possibility of voluntary body be more prominently represent ?

21725-1980-07-24.11.23.21.1-labour	as my hon .friend say , all these issue be interlock .many people outside the House , hear about cash limit on nationalise industry or cutback on public expenditure , believe that what be involved be a reduction in bureaucracy or administration .they have not grasp — I do not think any of we have — that industrial job be put at risk .the interlock nature of the problem be not easily understand .day by day , it mean factory closure , lay - off and short - time working .until the Government understand that they have the power to make some impact on the appalling unemployment situation , we shall continue to suffer spiral unemployment .sensible use of the National Coal Board 's investment policy can help protect job and prove an investment in the future .these be real job .these be not the artificial job that the Secretary of State for Industry often attack in his heady day of Opposition .they be real job .they be the sort of job that this country have to maintain if it be to be in a position to expand its industrial base when the slump eventually ease .

22606-1980-07-29.6.1.168.7-conservative	I be encourage by the determination of my right hon .friend to reduce expenditure in the public sector .nothing demoralise the wealth creator of our nation more than to see a large proportion of their hard - earn profit go to support bureaucracy .it be right that the taxpayer should decide how much the service of those we employ be worth .

10511-1980-07-30.11.1.35.13-labour	I wish to make one last point in respect of the Green Paper .it ought to be take on board by Conservative Members who complain during the year when my party be in power about the growth of bureaucracy .the only way in which one can complain about the growth of public bureaucracy be by be able to know its size .when it be in the public sector , Members of Parliament can table question and make point in debate , and therefore they can challenge the argument because they have the fact .

21659-1980-08-07.11.1.3.3-conservative	the new arrangement be base on recommendation result from a study of the administration of the current scheme make in consultation with Sir Derek Rayner .they be design to reduce bureaucracy , cut the number of form that farmer have to fill up , generally speed up the whole process and leave farmer with more responsibility for their own investment decision .
10573-1980-08-07.11.1.12.3-labour	in the long term , the outcome of these change will be damaging for the agriculture industry .if my fear and those of the conservation organisation be justify , and if instance of significant damage result from investment make by obtain these grant without proper prior approval and consideration of the conservation issue , the clamour to subject agriculture to the normal planning procedure will grow .at present , farmer can erect building without make planning application to the local planning authority .the failure of these regulation — and I regret to say that as propose they be destine to fail — will lead to a grow resentment .it will be unfortunate if farmer be subject to the whole bureaucracy of the local government planning system when they seek to erect relatively minor building .
18560-1980-08-07.11.1.17.1-conservative	as a practising , practical , less - favour tenant farmer , who have avail himself of grant on numerous occasion , I heartily welcome the Government 's move .the simplication be something that we farmer who use the scheme will greatly welcome , because the less bureaucracy that we have to go through , the well .
10171-1980-08-07.11.1.35.5-labour	in the national park , and on Exmoor especially , there should be a presumption against the further reclamation of moorland for farming purpose .at present there be no presumption towards either allow the ploughing of moorland or the retention of moorland .that unclear area of discretion be an area in which bureaucracy flourish .

10171-1980-08-07.11.1.35.7-labour	it would be well for Exmoor — well from the point of view of conserve it , well from the point of view of farmer who would not need to make application that would not succeed , and well from the point of view of reduce bureaucracy — if the Government set out and maintain a clear presumption in favour of retain moorland when deal with its reclamation in national park .
18711-1980-08-07.11.1.36.5-conservative	the new interface between farmer and the national park may make it more difficult for the park to improve their relationship with the farming community .decision that might have seem acceptable if they have come from the ADAS representative may seem less acceptable to farmer when they come from the national park .farmer may be more inclined to challenge decision from the national park than from ADAS representative .that be a problem , but it should not prove to be insurmountable .to what extent be the effect of the regulation in the national park simply to transfer manpower requirement from the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food to the national park bureaucracy ?can my hon .friend give the House an assurance that there will be no requirement to increase manpower in the Peak District national park as a result of the new obligation that the regulation place upon the national park ?

21659-1980-08-07.11.1.45.14-conservative	finally , the hon .Gentleman refer to the cut .my Department can , will and intend to bear its share of the full economy which must take place across Whitehall .in make these cut , we have seek to impinge upon the farming community as little as possible .this be a fundamental change in bureaucracy , organisation and form - filling .we believe that the farming community can and should be trust to make its own decision .
21659-1980-08-07.11.1.48.2-conservative	I emphasise again that the purpose of the scheme be advice , not bureaucracy .I commend it to the House .
16428-1980-08-07.12.1.11.6-conservative	secondly , I should like to deal with catch reporting , which be refer to in document no .8583/80 .a considerable amount of detailed work remain to be do .it be a crucial aspect of the common fishery policy .as I be sure the House will agree , and as anyone who know about fishing will agree , if a common fishery policy be to be effective there must be common standard .those standard must be properly apply by all country , government and industry within the EEC .our objective in relation to catch reporting be to obtain an effective system .if a system be not effective , it be not worth anything .negotiation be take place because we want a system that do not add any unnecessary administration and bureaucracy .in addition , the effectiveness of the system must not be sacrifice .
22490-1980-10-27.11.1.2.6-conservative	secondly , it have be widely agree that the multi - tier structure below regional level be unduly cumbersome , involve confusion of authority , unnecessary bureaucracy and excessive management cost .there have be widespread support for a single - tier health authority below regional level , base in most case on exist health district .
22490-1980-10-27.11.1.2.13-conservative	so our plan be , first , to eliminate the area tier and to set up district health authority cover population of between 150,000 and 500,000 .secondly , we shall simplify substantially the management structure below the level of the district health authority in order to cut bureaucracy and strengthen local management .
21954-1980-10-27.11.1.34.4-conservative	in the present economic climate the solution be not to be find in merely pump more money freely into it , even if that money be available .therefore , quite rightly , the present Government identify that the well use of exist resource and a cutback in bureaucracy be the priority policy to be follow .I be glad to give they my support for what they have do so far .
17347-1980-10-27.11.1.52.2-conservative	doctor , dentist and nurse have be demoralise and disenchant not only because they have see scarce resource waste on administration but because they have be smother by red tape and tier of bureaucracy .I believe that it be correct that in future , on the whole , the organisation should be in the hand of the small district authority , which will be more sensitive to local need .these proposal be a positive step towards make sure that the Service will be more personal and responsive to public opinion , however , I should like my right hon .friend to give far detailed consideration to the future and the organisation of the community dental service , as this may well be more difficult to organise at district level .
17347-1980-10-27.11.1.52.12-conservative	I should like to make one further but important point .it be remarkable that in these new proposal little mention be make of financial control .last year a highly respected small hospital in my constituency be close , albeit temporarily .it be most frustrating that we could not be assure at that time that there have be any real economy in the bureaucracy .I still see no evidence that the growth of bureaucracy and the cost of administration in the district health authority will be more closely monitor in future .I hope that my right hon .friend will give urgent consideration to this matter .
10647-1980-10-29.10.1.53.4-conservative	I come up through small business , and I be sick to death of the bureaucratic reply that I have have to my representation over the past six to nine month .I may get no high than the Back Benches , but at least I speak for part of the british economy that produce the wealth that enable the public sector to exist .how right Mr. Harold Macmillan be when , year ago on that excellent programme he tell Mr. McKenzie that the system be a pyramid and all the worker help to pay for the king or tribal chief .it be now an inverted pyramid .the manufacturing base be the tiny bit at the bottom , and it have to sustain the huge administrative bureaucracy and public sector on top .
19551-1980-10-29.10.1.59.3-conservative	I should like the House to consider the following .Britain 's training system for produce the skilled manpower require for a modern and competitive manufacturing base be still the bad in the West .the Industrial Training Act 1964 and the revision of 1973 have in no way solve the problem .we now have a sizeable training bureaucracy , and we have considerable effort devote to training by employer , trade union and Government official .but there continue to be serious complaint about skill shortage and the failure of the training system to respond adequately to industry 's change need .much of the argument in term of industry 's problem be the fact that we have not be responsive to the change need of consumer both in this country and abroad .
18050-1980-10-29.14.1.2.5-conservative	my hon .friend the Minister will know from correspondence that I have have with his Department of my interest in the case of two scottish shipbuilding company that be gravely affect by the Act , namely , Yarrow and Scott Lithgow .they be two fine , long - establish scottish company , with world - wide reputation , which the previous Labour Government be able to nationalise , move .control from scottish hand to the Whitehall bureaucracy only with the active connivance of the Scottish National Party .to date , Yarrow , have secure only £ 6 million in compensation—£1 million less than its pre - tax profit in 1974 alone .Scott Lithgow have receive , on account , the princely sum of £ 750,000 .
18333-1980-10-30.4.1.37.1-conservative	as the EEC draft directive on product liability , which we shall discuss next week , be cause a great amount of concern and worry in commerce and industry , as it will massively increase cost and bureaucracy , can my right hon .friend tell the House what action can be take on Tuesday to prevent the thing from ever see the light of day ?when he reply I would be grateful if he do not say something about harmonisation be important to our industry , at a time when european food and the budget effectively cost every industrial worker in this country £ 2 a week .
22529-1980-11-04.3.3.6.1-conservative	the programme be go well .there have be a few complaint about the bureaucracy and fill in of form .I have discuss the matter with the Manpower Services Commission which be examine whether it would be possible to simplify the form .we have to be careful to ensure that there be an element of training , and not an element of job substitution , in the programme .
22595-1980-11-04.6.1.70.7-conservative	in look at the directive in detail , I should say , first of all , have be fairly critical at the onset of my speech , that I recognise that , in meet the social and community expectation of the Community , the fundamental change from the exist negligence system to strict liability be inevitable .much of what I have say about increase bureaucracy and the increase problem of firm can still be achieve if one accept this inevitable change through the detail contain in this slightly complex document .I be not say that I oppose the acceptance of the principle .like most speaker tonight , I feel that it be inevitable .it be part of society 's change .in an increasingly sophisticated society , the requirement for more liability or more protection will arise .but it be the way in which we do it or the way in which this fundamental change apply in certain area that will be important .

21889-1980-11-11.12.5.23.6-labour	I ask the Under - Secretary of State for Scotland to say whether he be likely to use the power that be be seek .will he proceed in a relaxed way , seek voluntary compliance and ignore the almost hysterical approach that be be adopt by some Conservatives in Scotland , who seem to think that the attack on bureaucracy be the answer to all our economic problem ?
10342-1980-11-11.12.5.44.7-conservative	I be pleased to hear the remark of the hon .member for Liverpool , Edge Hill ( Mr. Alton ) .I believe that we reach agreement in Committee .no one be against the publication of more information .only those with something to hide could possibly resent that .we be opposed to bureaucracy in the sense of overbearing demand for unnecessarily elaborate information .I trust that all hon .member would expect this House , the Government , local authority and other public body to be prepared to publish meaningful information .
21695-1980-11-11.12.13.6.2-conservative	have my hon .friend the Under - Secretary of State give any further consideration to the possibility that clause 8 should not be implement until 1 April 1982 ?I ask that not because I be against the clause but because , if this provision be implement forthwith , it will allow very little time for local authority — particularly county council — to set up the accounting machinery .this be important because , from a preliminary consideration , it seem likely that , for example , the implementation of clause 8 could give rise to a direct increase in staff of up to 330 in the highway department of county council .the county council do not want to increase staff and the Secretary of State do not want to increase staff .however , it be possible that such an increase , or a less increase , can be avoid if the local authority have reasonable time to consider how to implement this provision without add to their bureaucracy .
21984-1980-11-11.12.60.16.7-conservative	I be grateful for the observation of my right hon .and learn Friend the Member for Hexham ( Mr. Rippon ) .half a loaf be well than no loaf at all , in term of the cost of collection .I wonder why it be that , whenever local government be put in a position of collect fee or do some such thing , automatically people talk about increase manpower .we say in Committee and we have constantly repeat that if we keep this as a simple procedure , under which everyone know exactly what the fee will be for a planning application , it should be a very simple matter to open an envelope in the planning department of the town hall and extract a cheque which ought to match up with the fee .in no circumstance do we see the growth of bureaucracy that certain people be cast around as be the consequence of our action .
22547-1980-11-12.8.1.105.9-conservative	a further point which have not be touch on previously this evening be the assumption that efficiency will somehow be bring about by spend more money on a big bureaucracy , whether it be for a major party , such as that of the present Government , or a small party .I do not accept that spend more money mean that one will be more efficient and effective .I have hear no case put forward to suggest that opposition have become more effective since these proposal originate in 1975 .
22547-1980-11-12.8.1.105.11-conservative	finally , the argument have be advance that people will be pay badly if there be not public fund available to supplement their salary .I suggest that it be incumbent on the Opposition party , whichever they may be at any give time , to pay their staff the proper go rate for the job and to make sure , therefore , that they use the number of staff that they can afford to pay .the staff should be pay properly , but the number and size of the bureaucracy should never be consider as be the measure of the efficiency of the back - up to political party .
22577-1980-11-12.8.1.106.5-conservative	the point that we must argue today be that if we agree that it be right and proper , have accept the principle of provide financial assistance to Opposition party , to index an increase in the fund for Opposition party , where will that take we eventually ?the local party in my constituency have to sustain a bureaucracy .my agent and my secretary be pay for by the local conservative association , and they often have to undertake the equivalent of parliamentary constituency work in my constituency .they make arrangement on my behalf , for which my local party pay .they make arrangement for my surgery and for many of my constituency engagement that I do not consider to be of a political nature , but I do not suggest for one moment that public fund should be give to that area of the Conservative Party 's activity in my constituency which relate to carry out the hon .Member 's duty .
17319-1980-11-20.10.1.85.4-labour	my last point concern health .I think that I might follow the hon .member for Canterbury ( Mr. Crouch ) .quite often either he follow I or I follow he when discuss health matter .I can not see any mention of health or social service in the Queen 's Speech .public expenditure be to be cut , and that may affect the Health Service .during the weekend there be an indication from the Minister for Health that the Government would put forward plan early next year to introduce the insurance principle into the National Health Service .why do they propose to do that ?it be not to improve the efficiency , to lessen the bureaucracy and the cost of the Health Service .the Government be look at insurance scheme overseas .I have look at scheme overseas , and there have be study of country with insurance - base scheme .the bureaucratic burden and the cost be heavy .that be why we have the National Health Service .we hope to make some improvement in the current reorganisation to put right what be do by a previous Conservative Government .nevertheless , the administrative rate be low than that of almost any other service in the world provide a broad base of health care .the Government 's proposal be nothing other than a method of try to save money .
17097-1980-11-20.10.1.112.9-conservative	it be difficult to explain the Commission and its bureaucracy , its bureaucratic approach to harmonisation , which be harmonisation almost for its own sake .but these be not the real matter of the Common Market .

10639-1981-02-06.4.1.100.5-labour	fear of reveal too much background datum be not only a Civil Service phenomenon , as have be suggest .minister be equally at fault .at the end of the day , they have the final word — whether they be Labour Ministers or Conservative Ministers .but that be a feature of all bureaucracy .we find the same feature in industry when we try to talk about the concept of industrial democracy .that be often not for invalid reason , machiavellian reason , or for the sake of be awkward .sometimes there be fear , such as the fear that what can be reveal may be only partial information , and the part that can not be reveal be actually more conclusive in decide how the policy will be evolve .
17947-1981-02-09.3.5.6.1-conservative	the hon .Gentleman express a fairly widely hold view , but all the power hold by the scottish and Welsh Development Agencies respectively be hold , though by different agency , in the North .to add an agency on the line of the scottish or Welsh Development Agency for the North would not provide a single extra power but would provide an extra unit of bureaucracy which would confuse rather than increase the prospect for the North .
22529-1981-02-09.8.1.2.7-conservative	these provision be necessary as a result of the Government 's decision to withdraw Exchequer funding of board ' operating cost .I should like to remind the House that when industrial training board be first establish under the 1964 Act their operating cost be charge to their industry .however , when firm become entitle to exemption from levy if they train to meet their own need , it mean that relatively few firm might remain liable to pay levy .obviously they could not be expect to pay all the operating expense .provision be therefore make in the 1973 Act accordingly , and since then the Government have meet the cost of the operating expense .in many respect , this have not work well .it have lead to an increase in bureaucracy and inefficiency and many complication about the pay and condition of staff .
22529-1981-02-09.8.1.4.2-conservative	one of the main point constantly put to I by chairman of board be that the growth of bureaucracy in deal with the Manpower Services Commission and in turn with the Department of Employment and in turn with the Civil Service Department have add considerably both to the time spend and to the cost of run the board .I do not think that what the hon .Gentleman have say need happen , but we can examine it in great detail as the debate go on .
17660-1981-02-09.8.1.9.1-conservative	many conservative member understand the need for urgency .however , will my right hon .friend reassure we that the MSC will not jump the gun on this matter ?there be a rumour that it be already plan an increase of over 800 in its staff .many of we feel that it would be wrong to replace industrial training board adviser with a new monitoring bureaucracy in the MSC .
22529-1981-02-09.8.1.10.1-conservative	I can give that assurance , because that be not what the MSC be tell I .under difficult circumstance , I be make very considerable cut in the MSC .over four year — and I be perfectly proud and happy to say so — I be make a cut of over 20 per cent .in the number employ in the MSC , with the exception that because of the increase that ] announce in the employment measure before Christmas there will be an additional 900 people , approximately , employ for the YOP and the community enterprise programme .but , generally , the MSC be have to accept a cut .I think that I be right in say that it be 21·4 per cent .of its total manpower .I be determined that we should spend the money on training and not on bureaucracy .that be why I want to get on with this as quickly as possible .

22052-1981-02-09.8.1.30.6-conservative	we know what our target be .they be to reduce bureaucracy , improve standard , build upon the good experience that we have , ensure a training system that be flexible enough to cope with a rapidly change future , and give the taxpayer and industry value for money .I be sure that there will be saving as a result of the review , but it must be clear to all that , with unemployment likely to face the country for a considerable time , they will not be absolute ; the money will have to be spend elsewhere on manpower programme , particularly to protect the weak in our society from the present intolerable level of unemployment .
17660-1981-02-09.8.1.44.9-conservative	I see one great danger .it be not just the lack of sanction .as my hon .friend the Member for Croydon , North - West ( Mr. Taylor ) suggest , the trade associaion have a vested interest .I do not trust some of they .there would be empire building .some of they would be look for an extra role .therefore , we must have some form of statutory quality factor .we must lay down standard that they should be expect to meet .the danger to which I want to draw attention be that we shall develop a new and ever large supervisory bureaucracy .the MSC number will increase as it attempt to keep a check on the voluntary system to make sure that it be do its job .
22075-1981-02-09.8.1.64.4-conservative	I agree with my hon .friend the Member for the Wrekin ( Mr. Hawksley ) that it be likely that , where there be a voluntary board or a voluntary association , because the same form filling and bureaucracy will not exist , the operating cost be likely to be less .however , in relation to transfer cost and the point make by my hon .friend the Member for Beeston and the right hon .member for Doncaster , my right hon .friend the Secretary of State and I have accept that thing will be difficult for industry during the present recession .my right hon .friend say that he be prepared to be reasonably flexible .it would therefore be unjust and wrong to say that we have not take account of this matter .

17067-1981-02-12.9.1.140.12-labour	I see the Bill as a spurious and shoddy piece of legislation which will do little for Scotland 's young people today , and will certainly not prepare they for the world of tomorrow .despite what have be say about some of the bureaucracy , the zoning and other arrangement will provoke a shamble in the administration of scottish education over the come year .
22588-1981-02-12.9.1.143.2-conservative	at the risk of my reputation , I must say that I agree with the hon .Member for West Stirlingshire ( Mr. Canavan ) on one matter .I agree with his proposition that a name person should handle the case of child with special educational need .one of the problem of bureaucracy be know where to start and how to tackle it .that suggestion would not impose a serious burden on the education authority , and would be of immense benefit .

21651-1981-02-12.9.1.159.4-conservative	the right hon .member for Craigton criticise the provision for parental choice .I do not think that he do so because he object to parental choice .from his speech , it appear that he have not fully consider the provision relate either to parental choice of to the assist place scheme .the Opposition should be concern about the image that they present in more than one respect .they constantly represent the bureaucracy .they be forever come to debate and talk about the need to support and help the administration of housing , education and local authority .yet , as the so - call people 's party , the opposition seem to have little time for the choice and aspiration of those whom they claim to represent .
21651-1981-02-12.9.1.163.10-conservative	we have , therefore , the prospect of produce , for the first time in 20 year , a scottish education Bill of significance , which I believe will be well appreciate by the user of the education system in Scotland .I agree that it be slant towards the consumer rather than the education authority , and I make no apology for that , because it be in that area that the imbalance so clearly lie at the moment .that be why I have be astonish to hear one Labour spokesman after another defend the bureaucracy against the interest of the people they claim to represent .
22716-1981-02-13.4.1.70.2-conservative	the Bill be worthy and well - intentione , but perhaps the emphasis in it should move away from the desire to have right when deal with the law and with bureaucracy — which I can not believe would enrich the language and its culture — and be place on other area , such as those hint at in clause 6 , deal with the preservation of the language through broadcasting .that be surely where most good could be do to the language and culture of the Gael .but that be a matter to be develop in Committee .meanwhile , I wish the Bill a very fair wind .
10601-1981-02-17.6.1.1.10-conservative	I cite just two example of bureaucracy .one involve an employee who work a five - day week .this lady have difficulty in get her hair do on a Saturday , so she ask her employer whether she could work Saturday morning and have Friday afternoon off .this be mutually agree .when the wage inspector come round , the employer be in great trouble for not have pay she five and a half day ' pay because she be entitle to double time on a Saturday .
10601-1981-02-17.6.1.1.16-conservative	I seek the support of both side of the House for the Bill .I ask for support from the Opposition because of their well - know wish to increase job opportunity for young people and in particular for the less able and for the ethnic minority .in addition , I suggest to my right hon .and hon .friend that they should support the Bill because of their opposition to quango and bureaucracy and their policy of reduce the burden on small business .on that score , I would expect also to have the support of hon .member on the Liberal Bench , which unfortunately appear to be empty .
10223-1981-02-17.6.1.2.10-labour	we be tell that wage council be over - bureaucratic .the truth be that they have 270 employee serve virtually 3 million people and nearly 400,000 establishment .that be hardly an excess of bureaucracy .the wage council have only 270 employee as oppose to the 4,500 social security fraud inspector , whose number be go up .yet the Government have propose a decimation of the already deplete rank of the wage council inspector , which will make it even easy for people to avoid pay the minimum rate .

10420-1981-03-03.10.1.10.1-labour	like my hon .friend the Member for Edmonton ( Mr. Graham ) , I be opposed to the introduction of these regulation .I have often hear conservative member say that they want to do away with bureaucracy in local government , yet they be now introduce measure which will add to that bureaucracy .
10374-1981-03-03.10.1.17.3-conservative	I be sure that my right hon .friend the Secretary of State and my hon .friend the Minister recognise that no new charge be likely to be popular .the imposition of these charge will lead the public to scrutinise carefully the bureaucracy that administer the system of planning and building control .that would be a good thing .I do not suppose that it be fully realise that the cost of planning control be £ 63 million .at least , that be my quick estimate , which I have base on the proposition that £ 38 million be 60 per cent .of that figure .
10099-1981-03-03.10.1.18.1-conservative	do my hon .friend agree that whatever charge an applicant may have to pay under building regulation or under this statutory instrument be but peanut in comparison with the extra cost of development that arise from unnecessary delay ?if the Government wish to pursue only one aspect , they could not do well than to minimise not only the unnecessary bureaucracy but the penal financial implication of unnecessary delay .
16469-1981-03-03.10.1.20.6-liberal_democrats	tonight , I oppose the regulation because I and my hon .friend be convince that the introduction of fee for planning application be an infringement of basic civil liberty .it be ludicrous and a travesty of justice that individual should be charge for restriction which be design to safeguard the people as a whole .furthermore , the introduction of these fee in the regulation necessarily imply the need to establish a bureaucracy to collect the fee , yet the Secretary of State be one of those who be constantly hector and lecture we about the need to reduce bureaucracy .
19563-1981-03-03.10.1.22.1-labour	the origin of these fee go back to the day when the Government say that they intend to simplify planning procedure and reduce bureaucracy .the undoubted consequence of the regulation will be to complicate application and increase bureaucracy at local level .that be bind to be the outcome .it be a sad commentary on the outcome of the original intention .I hope , even at this stage , that Ministers will think it wise to withdraw the regulation .
19563-1981-03-03.10.1.22.3-labour	another example relate to an application for a sign which will act as a guide in the direction of the applicant 's business .the person behind the desk in the planning office have to decide whether the business in question be visible from the point where the sign be erect .how that can be do from a planning desk , I simply do not know .if a hotel can be see from the point where the sign be point towards it , the fee be only £ 10 , but it be £ 40 if the hotel can not be see from that point .clearly , there will be disagreement about that .surely , it can never have be the Government 's intention to have such a complicated system whereby Whitehall decide whether a person pay £ 40 or £ 10 depend on whether there be tree between a hotel and a sign .that be Whitehall bureaucracy go mad .

19504-1981-03-06.3.1.22.5-conservative	my hon .friend the Member for Dudley , West , like I , be always anxious to ensure that there be not too many layer of bureaucracy .I hope that that aim be share by all hon .member .however , there be a danger of an overlapping of control .some of the measure propose be also cover in legislation affect health and safety , planning and cruelty to animal .I hope that we can ensure that we do not duplicate exist regulation , even if it be more appropriate that they should be concentrate in this Bill , rather than in other measure .

16394-1981-03-10.8.19.9.3-ulster_popular_unionist	as we have hear from the Minister , the reason why these charge be be impose be to bring in revenue to pay for the bureaucracy which already exist in Northern Ireland .as have be point out by the hon .Member for Belfast , West ( Mr. Fitt ) , we have an example this afternoon in the Budget which show that the Government be out to penalise people as much as possible .unfortunately , the majority of people who be be penalise be the ordinary man and woman in the community .planning consent be not a privilege .everyone have the right to make a planning application , but no one may erect or extend a building without obtain planning permission .therefore , it be not proper for the Government to charge people for fulfil an obligation that be impose by law .that be wrong in principle , and I take strong objection to it .it be necessary to protect the environment and we must , therefore , have proper planning .it be right that plan should be submit to public scrutiny .we must ensure that a building or extension will not be offensive to resident or the environment .

22181-1981-03-16.54.1.5.10-labour	let I quote directly from three authority which no doubt have make their view know to the member serve their area .first , Blaby council write : although a number of individual will be less constrain by plan control , even a great number will be provoke by their absence .although the number of application would be reduce , additional time would be take determine which proposal constitute permit development and deal with the enquiry and complaint which would be generate .I quote the view of the London borough of Barnet : Proposal ( a ) in the consultation document be consider unacceptable in the Metropolitan area where density of development be already relatively high and would inevitably result in extension which would be visually unsatisfactory and adversely affect the amenity of adjoining property .furthermore , even though such a relaxation would result in a reduction in the number of application for planning permission , there would be unlikely to be a reduction in the vetting procedure to define permit development , and certainly no reduction in correspondence arise from development actually undertake .I now quote from a letter from the South Oxfordshire district council , a council which I be sure be well known to the Secretary of State .the chief planning officer , a Mr. Phillips , write : it be my personal opinion that a reasonable professional process will merely be replace by a legalistic bureaucratic one … change the GDO will increase the work involve in volume and make the calculation more complex .no doubt the Ombudsman will confirm that dispute between neighbour very quickly become dispute between the aggrieved neighbour and the local planning authority , and explain the legal aspect of permit development be time consume when the people concern be obviously affect in an adverse way by the exercise of such permit development right .Mr. Phillips go on to say : I have give Mr. Heseltine , who be the Member of Parliament for a large part of this district , information to the effect that his proposal could reduce our application by 5 per cent .in number but that overall our workload could well increase , and I give the reason outline above .I feel very strongly that it be totally wrong for the Government to introduce legislative change to achieve bogus objective .the same gentleman write to I after the modification have be notify , say : I have repeatedly tell the Secretary of State and the DoE , that deal with an application be often quick than argue about whether it be permit development , and a good deal more rewarding for the professional staff .these order be a hotch - potch .however much the Secretary of State try to justify they as need or essential , however much he use jargon or gimmick , he will not do so in response to the demand of the people or the profession .he will seek to justify they on the ground that they will add to his armoury of weapon in his fight against bureaucracy and waste .his zeal be misplace , but , bad , he demean and diminish the work of a dedicated profession and democratically elect local councillor .he will gravely damage our environment ; he will set neighbour against neighbour ; he will bring our whole system of plan control into disrepute — all vainly to seek a reduction in public expenditure .in that he will fail , and we shall all be the poor .
22346-1981-03-16.54.1.11.2-conservative	of course , I believe that beauty , whether in the countryside or the town , must be protect .it be clear that national park and conservation area , which the hon .member seek to attach to Ponders End , have meaning in countryside and town .but an area of outstanding natural beauty be a vague concept .it be a vague creation of british bureaucracy at its good .we try to arrive at the right decision by empower a whole range of body to take decision about an area of countryside .if one want to see the nonsense that that sometimes produce , one have only to look at the Blackmore Vale , which be not in an area of outstanding natural beauty , and the Winterbourne Valley , which be .there be no possible reason for such a designation .one argue that Cranborne Chase should be designate because it will be treat differently if it be not .
18469-1981-03-16.54.1.12.5-conservative	I do not pretend that I know the answer .as I say , we be in a dilemma .we want to relax bureaucracy and increase individual freedom , and yet we sha nt to protect individual .I do not wish to be too pompous , but Edmund Burke say that if we could not have reform without injustice we should not have reform .yet we be engage in a reform that will create injustice for some individual , and that worry I .
21973-1981-03-16.54.1.17.4-conservative	we believe that it be important , where possible , to reduce the level of bureaucracy and the level of public expenditure and to free from control a large portion of those whose planning application be approve in full measure .about 93 per cent .of planning application of this sort already receive approval .we be not deal with a vast range of planning application that cause local authority grave disagreement when consider they .
19152-1981-03-16.54.1.20.1-labour	apart from one man 's petty bureaucracy be another man 's protection , be not the hon .Gentleman 's logic at fault when he argue that 93 per cent .of all household planning application make in 1979–80 be grant ?be it not clear that at present application be make with some care and with some concern for neighbour ?that be why they be accept .if there be a relaxation of the control , it do not follow that the same degree of care will be take .the chance of an authority reject an application will not be present to the same degree .
21973-1981-03-16.54.1.27.2-conservative	we can not foretell the precise effect of those change , but we estimate that they will take out of the planning system some 50,000 application a year , or perhaps more .that represent a significant gain in freedom to the individual citizen , a reduction in unnecessary bureaucracy and a saving in public expenditure .that be why I invite the House to support these measure .

10316-1981-03-26.7.1.84.18-conservative	I turn to marketing .I welcome what my right hon .friend say about the work that he have do since he take office .marketing form an indispensable part of a successful agriculture industry .unfortunately , it have be one of the weak aspect of british agriculture .there be a danger that in advance the cause of marketing we be likely to create the impression that we be interested in set up yet another bureaucracy .in short , the requirement to market must lead to a well marketing of the marketing system .it be necessary to convince those concerned that they need to engage in marketing .if they be not convinced there be the danger that they will consider marketing as merely another layer of bureaucracy .
16770-1981-03-26.8.1.16.1-ulster_unionist_party	I thank the hon .gentleman for give way .if the Government recognise that a diminution in bureaucracy will assist industry in a give area , surely it would be criminal not to diminish bureaucracy for the whole of industry .that be the logical extension of the hon .Member 's argument .therefore , a separate segment do not need to be create .

18009-1981-04-03.2.6.1.4-conservative	in addition to the grow unhappiness about the charge system , the underlie concern be not about the water supply but be base on a distrust of the management structure .water be a major business today and it should be run as such .there be no complaint about the executive management , but the proper non - executive control be lack .that bureaucracy which have be build up in the water authority must be consider , even if it mean legislation .I could well describe it as a mule — neither a horse nor a donkey .it be a mixture of local government representative and government - appoint member — the Thames water authority have over 60 appoint member .the anglian water authority have up to 40 .
18009-1981-04-03.2.6.1.5-conservative	the idea that the public receive a well service by increase local authority representation on the water authority be a red herring .local government representative on the water authority be already find it difficult to find out what be go on and difficult to attend meeting .in Wales they complain about the distance involve and they have no hope of control the bureaucracy .

16422-1981-04-28.3.15.6.1-conservative	it be not easy to see the connection between the hon .Gentleman 's question and what we be now discuss .if my right hon .and hon .friend be right when they say that business — and small business in particular — have suffer from too much bureaucracy , it be good news that since come into office we have cut down substantially the form filling which have to be do by business .
22561-1981-04-28.7.5.14.5-labour	I should like to explain in a nutshell why Hackney oppose the transfer of GLC property .all round we the GLC estate be tower of neglect .of course , it be not only the Conservative GLC or the bureaucracy that be to blame , but a substantial part of the neglect arise from the abdication of responsibility by this Tory GLC as a strategic housing authority .this have lead to what may not even be a conscious policy of neglect .caretaker be difficult to find .I wish that more could be recruit .I understand the problem from the point of view of the local authority and the GLC , but the fact remain that there have be a steady reduction in caretake and in caretake standard .the GLC have fail , perhaps more than any local authority , to cope with tenant ' everyday problem .when people have a dampness problem in their flat , they want someone to call and to talk to they about it .often , even when a belate visit take place , the answer that be give be the wrong one — that it be due to condensation .later it be discover that condensation be not to blame but that the problem arise from structural defect that should have be notice long ago .all too often it be establish that the tenant be right to complain but have be fob off .

21906-1981-05-06.6.1.30.9-conservative	there be reason why it be desirable under our system to maintain the separateness of the two profession .one have a close relationship with the lay client .the other have a more aloof relationship with the lay client and be less subject to the complaint of over - close association with client .the solicitor ' branch of the profession be honourable .nothing should take away from the wonderful service that solicitor provide in our court and as circuit judge .however , there be a strong argument for resist the temptation to widen the wedge so that solicitor , who be close to bureaucracy , become judge in the high court .

16895-1981-06-01.6.1.71.5-conservative	the second reason for my concentrating on small business be that the Bill represent a further step in the Government 's effort to help small business .during the two year of this Government we have see many measure to help small business which in total amount to a substantial package .we have remove many of the restriction that use to face small businessess .we have reform many of the planning control and remove obstacle in employment law .we have reduce the burden of bureaucracy and raise financial incentive .we have greatly improve counselling service .the list be long and detailed and amount to an impressive package .
16895-1981-06-01.6.1.71.13-conservative	one of the great complaint from small business , which we all understand , be the amount of paper work impose by bureaucracy .we must remember that business man be active , go - ahead people who do not wish to be over - burden by detailed requirement .they do not want their activity cramp by office work .
16895-1981-06-01.6.1.71.14-conservative	the Government have already abolish more than 1 million form .the provision in the Bill relate to accountancy be part of a campaign to lessen the burden on small business man .at least the Government have the correct attitude .instead of ask themselves what it would be nice for the Government to know , establish a great procedure through which all that information flow , and make everyone dance to their whim , they have ask what be the irreducible minimum that the Government have to know .that be a different approach which , if adopt by every branch of Government , will mean that Government bureaucracy will be vastly reduce .that approach alone will reduce the burden of bureaucracy .I congratulate the Government on that attitude and initiative .

10327-1981-07-30.10.17.28.3-labour	however , bureaucracy exist now in the shape of the common agricultural policy and the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food which pile on grant and subsidy to encourage , in some case , the wrecking of the countryside .we have a system that encourage farmer to wreck downland for the production of cattle feed cake .then there be over - production of milk , and the milk be turn back into skim milk and feed to the cattle which produce the surplus in the first place .we be now spend £ 35 million a year on that .
18487-1981-07-30.10.61.22.1-conservative	I listen carefully to the remark of the hon .member for Stockport , North ( Mr. Bennett ) .the new clause propose radical change to the current procedure for long distance route .it require the Countryside Commission to make creation order for section of propose route where no public right of way currently exist before the Secretary of State have consider the merit of the route as a whole .it also require new route and all variation to exist route to be subject to an order - make procedure involve public advertisement and the holding of public inquiry or hearing if any objection or representation be make and not withdraw .we do not believe that such radical change involve increase bureaucracy be necessary .Most variation to exist route be make follow consultation and agreement by the Countryside Commission with interested party .it be well to secure right of way by agreement and to use creation order only as a last resort when negotiation have fail rather than to use such order as the standard procedure .
10211-1981-07-31.2.2.41.15-labour	may I ask a question which may float away in the air , as it have do so often ?I say the same to my right hon .friend the Member for Norwich , North when he be Secretary of State .why be it that we in Britain be unable to uprate pension and other benefit more frequently than once a year ?early this morning we hear about the four - month period necessary to prepare an uprating .however , the hon .member for Kensington also serve in the European Parliament , and he know only too well that other member country of the European Community have biannual uprating , and some be move towards even more frequent uprating .Italy , for example , which be not more wealthy than the United Kingdom , be able to uprate benefit more frequently .I hope that some effort will be make in this direction .I can not understand why our bureaucracy be so incapable of achieve that .
16443-1981-07-31.7.1.2.9-conservative	but , although there be abundant evidence of enthusiasm for and dedication to police work by individual special constable in various part of the country , I fear that I must tell the House that it do not seem to be match by any correspond enthusiasm for , or even positive interest in , the special constabulary by officialdom within the Government .as evidence for what I must call the persistently negative attitude show towards the special by the Home Office bureaucracy , I cite the most recent report of the Home Office work party on the special constabulary in 1975 and in 1981 .
16443-1981-07-31.7.1.2.18-conservative	fifthly , we should make a new appointment of a senior civil servant within the Home Office to have responsibility for the special constabulary .as my hon .and learn Friend the Minister of State will know from the recent successful appointment of a new director - general of the prison service , a new face within the bureaucracy can make an immense difference to policy and enthusiasm for that policy .
19492-1981-07-31.13.1.1.22-conservative	the situation be now become so severe that the Government should seriously consider the abolition of the GLC .the Government come to power with a mandate to get government off the back of the people .the GLC be a prime example of a redundant bureaucracy where this mandate could be fulfil .
19197-1981-10-19.7.3.34.2-conservative	the Government propose that the State bureaucracy should be reduce and that well provision should be make available to individual and firm who find that , even though they go to the registrar , they can not get accurate and up - to - date information about who own a firm .I believe that that be an improvement .we may find that it be not , in which case we can consider the matter again .the Government 's case be surely that the present gigantic list for which we be pay be less accurate as a source of information than the proposal in the Bill .
19197-1981-10-19.7.3.34.3-conservative	as a matter of principle , I be grateful when legislation propose to reduce bureaucracy .too often , company legislation from Labour and conservative government have seek to increase bureaucracy without provide a corresponding benefit to the citizen .
22561-1981-10-19.7.9.7.2-labour	the Minister should wait upon event .he should examine the position in due course although probably by then he will not be the Minister .he should try to ensure that unnecessary bureaucracy be avoid .the hon .Member for Chichester be ask the Minister to be too uncaring of the consequence that could emerge .basically , I support the Minister 's view in this matter .
22561-1981-10-19.7.31.14.2-labour	shroud in the misty argument about cut down on bureaucracy , which we have hear incessantly from the Under - Secretary , be the real argument for enable company within the area that I have describe to hide important aspect of information about their affair , or at least to make it more difficult for those seek such information to procure it .therefore , there remain a substantial area of conflict between the Government and ourselves on that matter .our approach be healthy .it be interesting to observe that the United States take much the same line .
22561-1981-10-19.7.31.14.8-labour	"""why do we say that the voluntary approach be inadequate ?we say that it be base essentially on a false proposition — that company be prepare all too readily to divulge the information .I do not believe that that be the evidence .but the the Government say """" we ought not to impose too great a bureaucracy on the private sector with regard to employment statement , pension requirement , pension reporting , and so on , because it have far too much to do """" .be it not strange that the Government employ the voluntary approach for company but refuse to do it for trade union ?with trade union there have to be the force of law , but with the private sector — even with modest provision such as these — we have to rely on the voluntary approach ."""
10011-1981-10-19.7.31.15.2-labour	in view of the comparative position in EEC country in term of reporting obligation , I stand somewhat amazed at the moderation of the term of the new clause .we know , particularly in relation to new clause 3 , that the addition of a new obligation be propose in respect of the statement .I concede that a balance must be strike between the argument that one be simply increase bureaucracy by such new obligation , create red tape and divert the business man from his true function of produce and sell the good , and the argument relate to the company 's social responsibility .under new clause 3 , the obligation be to be place only upon medium and large company , so the Government can not argue that it will be oppressive to small company .I suspect that all the information seek in new clause 3 be already readily available to the company in various form .it be , therefore , not a substantial obligation upon they simply to collate information which be probably already available to they if only they put it together .moreover , as my hon .friend have say , it be a move away from the nineteenth century definition of a company and the rather narrow definition of its obligation in respect only of its shareholder to the more modern concept of a company have community and social responsibility .certainly , the information seek in the new clause be of public concern .
22561-1981-10-20.4.7.5.4-labour	the Minister be fond of say that all these provision be design to secure great saving and an avoidance of bureaucracy .what saving do he envisage will be achieve ?I argue in Committee that the benefit that he seek to confer be likely to be largely cosmetic .one very large firm of accountant with which I have confer in this matter — a company of the high reputation in the profession and with no political axe to grind — argue that company within the particular category might have to spend rather more money , because they will require to have audit account .bank and the tax authority will require audited account from they .creditor might require audit account from they if there be to be some realistic discussion about debt .so what will be the saving at the end of the day ?
22165-1981-10-20.4.7.6.2-conservative	if the amendment be accept , the paper work , the bureaucracy and the amount of money that the company involve would have to spend on additional staff to produce all these statistic would be incredible .I have operate a small business for many year .certainly a turnover of £ 1.4 million be no indication of a large business .for the medium - sized business , turnover must not exceed £ 5.75 million ; that be about right .we wish this legislation to date itself for at least another three to five year .regardless of what the hon .member for Hackney , Central ( Mr. Davis ) have say about the figure of 50 and 250 staff for small and medium - sized business , I hope that my hon .friend will resist the amendment , because if there be one thing that small business do not need at this time it be further paper work or further reason to take on additional staff to advise the Department .
22067-1981-10-21.2.27.18.6-labour	it be absurd that youngster in my constituency should be treat in a different manner .Maltby have intermediate status and Rotherham and Mexborough and Wombwell be development area .it be quite right that they should be so categorise .their unemployment level be ridiculously high .Dinnington be even high , yet it be not assist .I hope that the Minister will not accept that the pattern of neat bureaucracy must always be the only criterion upon which decision be make .
10556-1981-10-22.2.5.6.2-labour	last night I address a meeting in my constituency organise by the Commission for Racial Equality .concern be express about the position of ethnic minority group who have certain anxiety , some of which I share , about the appeal procedure .have consider in depth how appeal be to be conduct , I consider that much well - intentione bureaucracy be involve and I wonder whether everybody will be able to find a way through .
16760-1981-10-22.2.5.7.3-conservative	the other problem to which the hon .Gentleman refer may affect other part of the community as well as those that he specify .understand bureaucratic procedure be not a problem only for ethnic minority .many people be baffle by bureaucracy .indeed , many hon .member who have to battle with bureaucracy be baffle by it and have to get outside help to show they the way through the stuff .

22579-1981-11-04.2.11.55.22-conservative	how can monetarism work in such circumstance ?I believe that urgent and strong action be still require in this vital area .first , the Government must press ahead urgently with massive privatisation to restore true public ownership as oppose to State ownership .state ownership be the great excuse for a big and big bureaucracy .
16469-1981-11-06.3.3.2.12-liberal_democrats	liverpool city council come to the same conclusion .in Graham Gaskin 's case it agree in October 1980 that the file should be make available , in principle , in case of individual dispute .that decision be take after the story appear in the Liverpool Echo and after the director of social service , Dr. Meredith Davies , say in an official statement to the press in August 1980 that he would prepare a report contain a detailed history of Graham Gaskin 's life while in the care of the local authority .he say that a copy would be make available to Graham 's solicitor .not only be that not do , but the chairman of the social service committee , Mr. Paul Clark , be refuse sight of the Gaskin file .fifteen month later Graham 's solicitor have not receive the report or the file .councillor eventually be allow to view its content .however , despite that decision , bureaucracy , red tape , obduracy , industrial dispute and sheer bloody - mindedness have conspire to deny Graham Gaskin sight of the file which spell out his life .the last 12 month have be a drone 's hive of indecision .
16431-1981-11-10.8.1.62.9-conservative	I support the imaginative proposal contain in the gracious Speech .I deplore the stereotype pro - nationalisation argument from the Labour Party and even from some of the soft option party .we live in a rapidly change world where new idea be need .new approach will never be achieve through the mechanism of large state - control bureaucracy .if we be to provide new job and new technology for the school leaver of the future , we must grapple with these outdated legacy of post - war Britain .the gracious Speech show that the Government be determined to face up to those change , and I give it my full support .
22072-1981-11-12.3.8.7.1-conservative	I be sure that it would improve they , but at the cost of a substantial increase in bureaucracy , number of staff involve , the number of form to be fill in and application to be make .there must be a balance between the statistical information that we would like to see and the cost of obtain it .
16595-1981-11-12.7.2.83.3-conservative	anyone who remember the service as they be when run by the local community will agree that nowadays there be usually a rotten service , which be vastly expensive and have involve massive staff increase , enormous bureaucracy and less service to the people .it be generally less responsive .
17616-1981-11-13.3.1.28.17-conservative	perhaps I be the last person to ask for more bureaucracy in general , but if we be to do an important job we need the tool , because otherwise we shall not overcome the power of the rest of the bureaucracy .if we could do that , there would be nothing to fight against , but as that be not likely , at least in the short term , more need to be do .
22575-1981-11-13.3.1.37.21-conservative	the Government 's effort to reduce the burden of taxation on small business and to provide they with new source of capital and lending have my full support .my right hon .and hon .friend will , I be sure , understand when I say that the strategy must be pursue far .our record be honourable .we have reduce the burden of bureaucracy and cut time - consume form filling .we have even undertake a review of the excessive power of entry enjoy by officer of almost every official body in Britain .however , we have not yet see the fundamental reform of capital taxation promise before the last election .if we have that reform , why can not my right hon .friend ensure that bond can be purchase in advance for payment of capital transfer tax that be not aggregable on the estate ?that would help many people to transfer family business .
10223-1981-11-13.3.1.38.3-labour	perhaps one factor in our failure industrially , and in some way politically be what have become almost a caste system .People enter government when they be young and retire many year later , if they be lucky , never have go out of the bureaucracy .if politician be fortunate , they begin their career at an early age and go to the House of Lords a couple of generation later .it would be far well for this country if there be a great willingness to develop an interchange between the various arm of administration , business and politic .that would give all of we a much well perspective and certainly improve the quality of decision - making in Government and industry .
10386-1981-11-13.3.1.45.19-conservative	I assure my hon .friend that I have a good and effective team .despite talk in the House about bureaucracy , the civil servant in my Department and the 65 who work in the small firm service — along with the 151 counsellor , who be business man themselves , of course — be in the front line with business and be enthusiastic about work for small business .wherever they go , they receive a good reception from small business man .
19270-1981-11-16.9.1.1.3-conservative	my proposal will therefore reduce the number of board from 23 to seven , exclude the Agricultural Training Board , which be responsible to my right hon .friend the Minister of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food , and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales .where statutory arrangement be to be remove , I be satisfied that the training requirement of the sector concern can be meet effectively on a voluntary basis with less cost and bureaucracy .I plan to make several change in the scope of the board that be to be retain .
19270-1981-11-16.9.1.23.2-conservative	the House must understand , however , that to a considerable extent the board be not so much about training as they be about bureaucracy .if we can get rid of the bureaucracy and move to voluntary arrangement and maintain the training , that be wholly good .of one board , for example , the Manpower Services Commission say : the board have not be able to influence train very materially either in quality or in quantity by use of its statutory power .that do not seem to be a good reason for keep such a board .
16998-1981-11-16.13.1.23.1-conservative	if Gilbert and Sullivan be alive today a political commentator would conclude that they have be active in the House this evening , because here we have a conservative Government — commit to cut bureaucracy , and cut State spending — introduce a socialist measure .
16998-1981-11-16.13.1.23.4-conservative	we have a Conservative Government who be committed to cut bureaucracy and to get the Government off the people 's back but who be introduce a scheme that will involve fill in form , put through return and provide inspector to ensure that the scheme be not be abuse .it be right , when State money be involve , that inspector should do that , but the proposal come from a Conservative Government .if we be sit on the Opposition Benches , we would oppose this measure .
16998-1981-11-16.13.1.27.2-conservative	I come from Merseyside , and many youth who leave school at the age of 15 would jump at the opportunity of a job at £ 30 a week .however , it be illegal for an employer to take on a school leaver at that wage .it be below the wage council rate .youth would willingly leave school and accept £ 30 per week , free of tax and the opportunity thereby provide , but wage council be price they out of job .the solution be not to subsidise or introduce more bureaucracy , but to allow those youth to work .we should not think that we can solve the problem by throw money at it .
19004-1981-11-17.4.1.3.1-conservative	be my right hon .friend aware that the announcement yesterday about industrial training board have already be widely welcome by industry and commerce as contribute to a useful reduction in bureaucracy and make it easy to provide cost - effective training ?however , could she find time in her busy day to consider whether more step could be take in the near future to make vocational training more widely available to all age group , especially school leaver ?

10212-1981-11-23.11.1.34.3-conservative	I say at the outset that our proposal be aim in part at reduce complexity and in part at reduce bureaucracy .the result will be that claimant will no long have to decide which of the two scheme provide the good assistance .the Department will save about 2,000 staff , and , although local authority will need extra staff , they too will be able to make some saving in rent and rate collection and in chase up rent arrear .
10212-1981-11-23.11.1.36.7-conservative	the Bill contain some of the most important change in social security provision that have be introduce in the past few year .the statutory sick pay scheme will avoid duplication of bureaucracy between the State and employer , and will lead to a substantial reduction in Civil Service post .it also realise the ambition of government over the past 30 year to bring sick pay into taxation .the housing benefit scheme also simplify administration and end the present confused system .in other word , the reform bring benefit both to the public as taxpayer and to the public as claimant .it be on that basis that I commend the Bill to the House .
18725-1981-11-23.11.1.63.7-conservative	the Bill be one of those rare measure that will save money and improve the quality of the service .this improve legislation will help to strengthen the relationship between employer and employee .it will result in a reduction in officialdom , bureaucracy and red tape .
19293-1981-11-23.11.1.87.6-conservative	I believe that the Bill be intend to bring current employment practice up to date .I can not understand , therefore , why the Bill still talk in term of a six - day week instead of a five day week .it seem that a 40 hour , five day week be now normal employment practice .if so , why be this figure not use in the Bill ?these point will I hope have effect only in the short term , but be nevertheless very important to employee now .I therefore welcome the general provision of the Bill as a further step to cut bureaucracy and encourage both employer and employee to rely more on their own negotiation and initiative and less on the State .
10565-1981-11-24.8.1.17.5-conservative	the free port be a simple concept that will bring great benefit and prosperity to such an ailing part of London .I think that all hon .member will agree that the fundamental requirement of city renewal be the attraction of fresh private investment into our decline urban area .that be the thrust of the Government 's enterprise zone , and the partnership , the urban aid and other urban development initiative .we must also lift unnecessary control and reduce bureaucracy .such consideration support the concept of establish a tax - free port , which — unlike enterprise zone and the urban development corporation — would require virtually no additional public fund and no extra staff on the public payroll .
10565-1981-11-24.8.1.21.3-conservative	there would be obvious advantage in establish a free port .factory locate in the zone would enjoy advantage similar to those that they would enjoy if they be locate abroad .business man would need to find less money for cash flow , so they could bring in good and take they out again without have to find capital to pay duty first .there would be less bureaucracy and paperwork .

10038-1982-02-18.9.1.74.3-labour	it be important that we consider the area in which people resent the bureaucracy in the Health Service .the vast majority of nurse and ancillary worker feel that they be undervalue and underpaid compare with other in the community and some administrator and consultant in hospital .they feel that they should have more recognition for their essential role .nurse be very bitter that they can not earn a decent wage unless they stop nurse and go into administration .the rate of pay for people who be qualified but who be not in charge of a ward be very poor .even a ward sister be not pay well , but , if she move away from nursing towards administration and become a nursing officer or a senior nursing officer , the salary scale be much more attractive .if the Government be talk about reorganise the Health Service , the first thing that they must do be to ensure that the people on whom the service depend — the nurse and ancillary staff — be pay a decent wage .

16394-1982-02-24.9.1.12.2-ulster_popular_unionist	I ask the hon .gentleman what reduction there would be in the number of civil servant .his answer be that there would be a reduction of one senior official .I be not convince that Government expenditure on bureaucracy will be reduce by the order .I think it will lead to an increase in expenditure .I fear that it will lead to inefficiency .there be no talk of the order lead to any saving .the Government should hold the order back .they be commit to the establishment of an elect assembly at Stormont before the end of the year .surely it make sense to leave discussion of the reorganisation of Government Departments to that elect body , which will have the onus of devise a system of devolve government in Northern Ireland .I do not know why the Government be rush the order forward .
16394-1982-02-24.9.1.14.4-ulster_popular_unionist	I be not satisfied that the Government have make out a case for the order .the Government have prove neither that the order will make administration in Northern Ireland more efficient , nor that it will produce any saving in the cost of the bureaucracy .as the Government be committed to establish an assembly at Stormont by the end of the year , it would be well to leave to the newly elect representative the task of advise on what be the good system of administration for the Province .

19209-1982-02-26.6.1.71.4-conservative	look back , most people would agree that the Government , in the early 1970 , make a catastrophic mistake by reorganise local government as they do .not only be old place name destroy for ever , but people lose their familiar landmark which be so love in England , and the new authority , so often remote from those whom they be suppose to serve , allow a vast new bureaucracy to be create which have be more difficult to control than even the Civil Service .the creation of new water authority — which have not be mention today — cause similar , if not great , problem .
21973-1982-02-26.6.1.81.4-conservative	the general breadth of my right hon .Friend 's remark show that we should be consider pretty hard the way in which local authority have operate their finance .he particularly refer to the ravage of capital expenditure cut which have be such a feature over the past 10 year or so of local authority spending , when the revenue account be increasingly high on extremely large work force and bureaucracy maintain at ratepayer ' expense .my right hon .friend the Secretary of State have be keenly conscious of the need to reverse that process and that be why we make so much progress on those aspect .

19551-1982-03-08.10.1.18.17-conservative	Most of the canadian population live in a dozen city string across a 4,000 - mile border with the United States .the rest of that huge country be virtually unpopulated except for small township and hamlet .in vast area of the mid - north and the far North , Indians be still the predominant population and their number be grow .unless one be an assimilationist , it make good sense that those indian community be allow to control themselves .it make no sense to attempt to control every aspect of their life through a huge bureaucracy several hundred or even a thousand mile distant .indian government be not only an implied right in the Royal Proclamation and in the treaty .it be plain common sense .
10565-1982-03-09.9.1.2.7-conservative	the purpose of this debate be to bring the situation to the attention of the country .these house , albeit abandon , could house thousand of homeless people .the property be abandon simply because of a vicious spiral of public bureaucracy and legislation which have lock the house into a state of constant decay .
17660-1982-03-12.3.1.63.14-conservative	we should ensure that apprentice be train up to engineering industry training board standard .who will ensure that the 1,000 apprentice in the food sector be train up to EITB standard ?the EITB , which be preserve , lack the capacity and be not engage extra people to monitor and judge standard in these other sector .this situation , together with the 21 - hour rule , seem to prove something important .the Government have move forward more than the previous Labour Government , but there be a danger that they will stumble on the way simply because the operational side be not right and that all sort of difficulty , hindrance and bottle neck will be allow to emerge .this can involve bureaucracy over the interpretation of the 21 - hour rule , the vacuum on the ITB sector front and doubt about whether the right people be in the right place to judge apprentice standard .these critical matter have to be resolve .
22493-1982-03-15.10.1.2.4-conservative	I have scan the local press to try to find out what be happen .if that be all that I have to go on as a parent with a child at a primary school in the constituency I should be as confused and angry as my constituent .the local evening paper , in a rare page one editorial comment on 12 February , sum up the position succinctly : will someone … please stand up and tell the poor bemused public what on earth be go on ?People be feed up to the hind tooth with the term ' government spending cut . 'neither do they want woolly explanation wrap up in statistic they do n't understand .they want simple answer to simple question .why , if it be all the fault of the government , be every education authority in Britain not in the same boat ?why have the county education committee be allow to overspend its budget in the past ?why be the present crisis not foresee and the public alert long before now ?the ratepayer suspect the bad .they suspect that there be an excessively high ratio of administrator to teacher .they suspect that councillor have be hide their head in the sand , hope that the evil day would never come .they suspect that bureaucracy have get the upper hand .they suspect these thing because councillor have not explain in a simple and straightforward manner why the present situation have arise .that be good fighting stuff .those may not be the right question to ask , but they provide a starting point .
19097-1982-03-16.10.1.1.7-conservative	one have only to hear some of the endless story that come from council estate to know why that be .house maintenance , delay and bureaucracy be poor .I do not necessarily blame the people involve .where there be over 100 , 000 house , as in Manchester , a particular kind of management structure be require .special skill be need to manage the complexity of such an estate efficiently .
10276-1982-03-17.3.11.2.1-conservative	no , Sir .I want to keep the partnership committee and the attendant bureaucracy as small as possible .partnership authority have be tell , however , that their inner area programme will not be approve if there have not be adequate consultation with the private sector .this appear to be produce the involvement I want to see .
17907-1982-03-22.9.1.12.25-conservative	in a recent debate I be highly critical of the reorganisation of the NHS .my right hon .and learn Friend the Member for Hertfordshire , East be correct to describe it as as quango .the commission will involve additional cost and bureaucracy , which I should have think be alien to the Government 's thought .however , if we must have it , we must ensure that it do not overlap exist National Health Service management or the other NHS watchdog , such as the Health Advisory Service , the Health Service Commissioners , Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and all .
10446-1982-03-25.20.1.38.9-labour	we be concerned whether all the modern technique be be use .one see in the court day after day that it be still the practice for policeman to write statement in longhand , take up hour of their time .do that mean that we have not avail ourselves of the new technique , so that while there may be more bobby , more of their time be be take up with bureaucracy and paper work ?I should like to know the figure .what be the increase in the number of hour that policeman spend on the beat ?that matter be crucial in safeguard our society .
18724-1982-03-30.7.12.48.13-labour	finally , the letter state : ( iv ) it will now be virtually impossible for optician to tell a patient what their NHS charge will be ( as between £ 7–40 and £ 30–00 ) until an examination have be complete and their prescription determine .it be almost as if bureaucracy run wild when the Government seek to make such change .the spin - off of increase cost never seem to be consider .the problem in the dental service be that a person be not inform whether he will receive treatment on the NHS or will have to pay privately .I quote a case in the Midlands , where there be only two dentist who be prepared to give NHS service .all the other dentist give only private service .
10584-1982-03-30.7.13.3.18-labour	at the moment , many direct labour organisation believe that they be well organised and can win contract against fair competition .for example , Manchester estimate that it have win 75 per cent .of the contract for which it have be tender .why should efficient dlo be burden with extra bureaucracy when they be already operate satisfactorily ?why should local authority be force to do less productive work and more paper work ?
17461-1982-03-30.7.13.15.1-labour	the legislation will make for more bureaucracy , not less .
22119-1982-03-30.7.13.16.3-conservative	a large number of small firm would like to take on work such as school maintenance .why should local authority be involve in such activity ?the reason why local government have increase be that it have become involve in work that should be put out to private contract .it be not the job of local authority to run everything in their area .that be the slippery road to over - bureaucracy , high cost and high rate .
22053-1982-03-31.10.13.13.4-conservative	there ar two concept in the amendment — that , if it wish , the BGC should come forward with alternative proposal for safety and that there sould be arbitration on disagreement .those be already in the Bill as draft , but the amendment seek to submerge the common carrier under a welter of superfluous bureaucracy .our intention be to operate — [ interruption . ]we be concerned about safety .if the hon .member for Merthyr Tydfil ( Mr. Rowland ) be not concerned about safety , he should not pretend that he be .
22053-1982-03-31.10.13.17.7-conservative	the concept of arbitration — the other part of the amendment — be also a duplication , because the whole purpose of clause 16 be to permit access to I as Secretary of State so that I can arbitrate on difference between the corporation and private supplier which it have not be possible to resolve through negotiation .the only effect of lay one arbitration on top of another , as the amendment propose , would be pointless delay and burgeon bureaucracy .
22118-1982-04-01.10.1.23.10-conservative	I hope that the two set of figure illustrate clearly the predicament of the far South - West .I hope also that I have be able to make it clear to my right hon .friend the Leader of the House , and through he to Ministers in the Department of the Environment , that the present regional boundary be totally unsatisfactory for the far South - West and that there be an urgent need to recognise the case for the creation of a genuine South - West region comprise Devon and Cornwall .this could easily be do without the fabric of a vast and costly new bureaucracy .there be a strong case on the ground of regional identity and regional consciousness .there be a strong case also in respect of the collection and dissemination of statistic on which policy emanate from Whitehall and Brussels be base .
21956-1982-04-05.10.47.8.5-social_democratic_party	my hon .friend in the Liberal Party and the SDP totally reject that approach .we believe that local government should be make more accountable , but downward to the elector and not upwards to the Secretary of State .the Bill be not a blueprint for self - confident , lively , democratic local government .it be a charter for central Government bureaucracy , and we shall vote against Third Reading tonight .
22087-1982-04-06.7.1.112.6-conservative	I be extremely disappointed that we could not fulfil our election promise of substantially cut the burden of income tax .I believe that that be something to which we must apply our mind urgently , because the present situation be totally absurd .I be not ask for any giveaway .the Government should reduce income tax dramatically and continue the present balance in the Budget by reduce public sector spending .only by do that and reduce the bureaucracy can we get the economy right .
19563-1982-04-06.7.1.117.8-labour	there be also the argument that public spending be excessive and that a bloated bureaucracy could be cut without damage .what be the truth ?as my hon .friend the Member for Bishop Auckland ( Mr. Foster ) remark , our education service be suffer from deeply damaging cut .morale in the Civil Service be the low for many year .there have be an obsessive attack on the public service .that have not produce a fraction of 1 per cent .of additional growth in the economy .
22094-1982-04-07.3.4.2.1-conservative	yes , Sir .an object be to cut bureaucracy and remove barrier to the change need .patronage of public transport have be decline and cost rise for a quarter of a century .the Act be give the travel public a well deal .
10631-1982-04-19.10.1.32.2-conservative	this be not the first time that I have sit on such a debate , because in another capacity I attend the previous one on 29 January 1981 .my right hon .friend the Secretary of State for Energy who be then Financial Secretary to the Treasury , refer to the Public Accounts Commitee as the House 's most potent instrument for the restraint of waste and bureaucracy .as someone who yield to no one in the House in his enthusiasm to curtail waste in the public sector and unnecessary bureaucracy , I believe that membership of the Public Accounts Committee would be a challenging and rewarding experience .

10631-1982-04-19.10.1.32.19-conservative	in the White Paper , the Government say that they want to see more , not less , involvement of the private sector in the audit of public spending , and to avoid overload the C & amp ; AG .again , I question the validity of those point because no one have suggest , at least , I doubt whether my colleague on the PAC be necessarily suggest , that we want to crowd out the private sector of the audit profession .however , we need someone to do something because this be public money .if it mean another half dozen employee as member of staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General I for one , although I be keen on reduce unnecessary bureaucracy , might be persuade that this would be public money well spend .time and again we come across demonstration and evidence of public money that be not be well spend .therefore , that too be a defence that I should question and find it difficult to accept .
10631-1982-04-19.10.1.32.29-conservative	obviously , there be a great deal that Sir Derek can contribute .give my own background , I retain some link with the bureaucracy .the story come to I from many friend within the bureaucracy , who be as dedicated as any hon .member to the sensible use of public resource , tend to suggest that sadly , Sir Derek 's exercise be a great deal less effective than some of we would hope that it should be , or than some ministerial statement suggest that it be .
22587-1982-04-20.4.3.7.1-conservative	do my right hon .friend agree that in recent year school have have devolve on they a great many administrative function formerly undertake centrally by local education authority and have be give facility to undertake the function ?therefore , do he also agree that the swelling of central bureaucracy be not as justified as other have suggest ?
16780-1982-04-21.7.1.59.14-labour	if we be to have a Government who base their public expenditure plan on a proper social and industrial strategy , the design and implementation of that strategy can not primarily be a matter for the Treasury or for the central Government Departments but must primarily be a matter for those in the field .if we tell those in local government , in the education system and in the National Health Service that resource be limit , but that we believe that they have a well idea than anyone else of how to run a tight ship , we would receive a constructive response .if we ask they to tell we the appropriate management system in , for example , the National Health Service to give good value for money , the pattern of spending would be quite different .there would he much more emphasis on preventive medicine and on deliver personal service and less on organisation and bureaucracy .however , because we have centrally plan and departmentally administer programme , rather than managerially devolve programme , our public expenditure system be out of control .

18853-1982-04-30.4.5.9.3-conservative	my hon .friend the Member for Fareham ( Mr Lloyd ) say that the number of certificate outstanding be only 47 .it be relevant to consider the scale of the operation in other sphere .in term of immigration , for example , for which I be responsible , 47 certificate be as nothing compare with the massive inflow of paperwork with which we try to cope .the certificate will be send to community association , club and society .I assure the House that they will be absorb .there will be no need for additional civil servant or more bureaucracy .
18853-1982-04-30.4.5.11.5-conservative	I have say that it be our aim to ensure that the fee be reasonable .the rough and ready yardstick of what be hold to be reasonable be a level of fee that be relate to the cost of the operation .if the cost of the operation be small — we do not envisage that it will be necessary to create a large bureaucracy to administer it — it should be possible to keep the fee low .I accept that it be desirable to keep the fee to a minimum .

22503-1982-05-07.3.1.15.12-conservative	however , there be a problem of bureaucracy .the secretary of the British Legion club in a small village in the heart of Suffolk will have to apply to something call the Home Office .the secretary will need to know exactly what that mean .unlike most Government Departments , the Home Office do not have regional or local branch office .the Customs and Excise do have such office .therefore , when the secretary of a club have a video cassette make up with which to show a little film in , for example , Norton , in the heart of Suffolk , or in one of the rural village , Mr. Deputy Speaker , in your constituency , he will have to write to the Home Office in Whitehall .
18366-1982-05-07.3.1.20.6-conservative	my hon .friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds ask what the procedure would be for acquire a certificate of exemption .he draw attention to the fairly modest scale of the organisation in village and rural area that would be apply for exemption .he say that the bureaucracy should not be so great that such organisation would be discourage , or would receive certificate long after the event in respect of which they be apply .my right hon .friend the Minister of State deal with this issue fairly extensively last week in column 1094 of Hansard .he make it plain that there will be a transfer of the function that be now undertake by Customs and Excise and that no new bureaucracy be envisage .it be a relatively simple matter .if a club do not admit the public on payment and it be not run for private gain , it will not need a cinematograph licence or an exempted organisation certificate .
10168-1982-05-11.8.1.28.4-labour	I want to give the Minister every chance to deal with the anger and sarcasm of his own supporter .they certainly throw up a large number of prickly point for he to deal with .I hope that he will give particular attention to the scottish situation , particularly the financial implication .the scheme be not cost - effective .it be of marginal relevance to the running of an efficient planning system and it be counter - productive in the sense that it have build - in waste and bureaucracy of a kind that no one want .

16437-1982-10-27.28.1.10.15-conservative	the system of movement permit be another important element in the new regulation .it have become apparent that a main problem in control the trade in unfit meat be the lack of detailed knowledge on the part of the enforcement authority about the disposal of unfit meat .the essence of the new system of documentary control be that the local authority responsible for any establishment despatch unfit meat should give prior authorisation to the movement and should , therefore , be fully inform on the detail of the consignment and when the meat arrive at its destination the permit will be forward to the local authority responsible for the receive establishment and will then be return to the authority that issue it .we be , of course , concern to avoid the unnecessary imposition of new paperwork and bureaucracy .I be delighted to assure my hon .friend the Member for Harborough ( Mr. Farr ) that the regulation allow for sensible arrangement to be work out by local authority for the issue of supply of movement permit where there be a regular trade between two establishment .the implication for local authority of have to deal with the additional documentation be fully discuss with the organisation .

18418-1982-11-03.9.1.93.4-social_democratic_party	I be convinced that part of the problem of unemployment in Britain can not be solve by Britain alone .one of the more positive aspect of the Community — and one of the aspect which could identify with ordinary people rather than the bureaucracy and the wrangle over budget — relate to the possibility of have a co - ordinated response to the problem of unemployment .although the Prime Minister attend the various summit meeting , one be always leave with the feeling that she go with little enthusiasm and with few idea .

21743-1982-11-16.8.1.51.2-labour	the one part of the Secretary of State 's speech with which I agree be that one reason for the current problem be the introduction of direct billing .even during the six year that the Labour Government be attack for their policy , but do their good to defend the water industry , conservative Members do not explain to their electorate that direct billing include both the supply of water and the disposal of sewage .that should have be meet with compensate reduction from local authority that no long have to provide for sewage and drainage .no doubt conservative member do not make that point because most local authority be under conservative control at that time .I feel that I have to draw attention to that deception .nor do conservative member investigate the cost of bureaucracy , although the Minister try to do so today .
22503-1982-11-16.8.1.78.8-conservative	clause 7 set out the arrangement for well communication with consumer .I freely confes that we do not handle the issue properly in the 1973 Act .change be long overdue , but I have one small criticism .there be too much power give to the Department to prescribe method .there will be variation between wide rural area such as that cover by the anglian water authority or the South - West authority and the heavily industrialise area .their problem and perception be different .too many of Bill 's power lie with the bureaucracy .the detail be set down too precisely .if my hon .friend the Minister or the Under - Secretary of State be handle the matter , there would be no problem , but Ministers will move on to their other duty and the official , estimable though they be , will monitor how the authority perform their new statutory duty .I believe that these control should be loosen in Committee .
22503-1982-11-16.8.1.82.4-conservative	as we move towards small and more efficiently manage executive board for our water authority and abandon the superstructure of the National Water Council and its various body , it will be all the more important that each regional water authority account for what it do .their accountability to consumer be improve but there must also be well accountability to the House .I hope that the Government be not head towards nationalisation .I do not believe that that be their intention , but there be a risk that the industry will be pull more and more into the central bureaucracy of the Department of the Environment .the Secretary of State 's innovation in local government — the concept of an efficiency audit to be report to this House — should also be introduce in the water industry .
22119-1982-11-16.8.1.98.5-conservative	Bureaucracy have also grow enormously .the comparatively new chairman of the Thames water authority have try to do something about it .Manpower figure have drop and I be impressed by the work that he have try to do .however , the bureaucracy remain vast .I visit a multinational company in my constituency that occupy one floor in an office block .the chairman say that he would try to reduce the number of those work there .I think that I meet two people there .however , the chairman think that the overhead be too great .he then take I by my coat collar , drag I to the window and point to a building on the other side of the road .he ask what the devil I be go to do about that place .it be a building for one division of the Thames water authority , yet there be 12 floor .somewhere along the line bureaucracy have get out of control .the new management board can pursue that point vigorously .the Thames water authority have be restructure itself , advisedly , and make divisional structure to streamline management .it have be proceed in the right way and this new idea may help .

22195-1982-11-16.8.1.172.5-labour	water authority have be and always will be criticise in the House .the main criticism that be level be remoteness , bureaucracy and , above all , charge .by almost abolish local authority representation the Bill exacerbate the problem of the remoteness of water authority from the general public .the Bill be also likely to increase water authority bureaucracy .we shall now see power concentrate in the hand of few non - elect individual .
22195-1982-11-16.8.1.180.4-labour	because the Bill increase the remoteness of water authority , add to bureaucracy and to the patronage of Secretaries of State and run away from the difficult problem of water charge , we shall vote against it .

18725-1982-11-23.8.1.93.10-conservative	I understand that the Secretary of State will designate certain competent person as approve inspector able to provide certificate of approval .those competent person must possess professional qualification , practical experience and be in possession of indemnity insurance .I appreciate that this definition encompass architect , engineer and surveyor .such a system have immediate attraction .despite what Labour member have say , it will result in less bureaucracy and time - wasting and will generally speed up matter in an industry where time be literally money .it will also reduce local government expenditure .
16431-1982-11-24.9.1.29.8-conservative	the present organisation of the british electricity supply industry combine the bad of all possible world .on the one hand it be highly centralised and top - heavy , and dominate by the powerful bureaucracy of the CEGB with its responsibility for the generation of electricity throughout England and Wales .on the other hand , its function be curiously fragment , with responsibility for sale and marketing separate from power generation and lie with 12 statutory area board that be relatively autonomous .float nebulously above the CEGB and the area board be the Electricity Council , a body with a general advisory role , but also charge with the two specific function of finance and industrial relation .altogether the electricity supply industry consist of a grand total of about 14 statutory body .it be neither truly centralise , nor truly decentralise .it manage to effect a complete split between the two major function of any commercial enterprise — production and sale .

19152-1983-01-18.10.3.9.29-labour	I shall not argue about whether what these new body do be necessary .that be not part of this debate .the Government think that it be necessary , and they have so persuade the Committee and the House on Second Reading .if that be so , they have a reciprocal obligation to see that the risk of so do , the risk of bureaucracy , and the risk inherent in every quango be deal with , and that the public be properly safeguard .that be fully in line with their election manifesto .
21743-1983-01-18.10.5.5.13-labour	I turn to the abuse of power .no one can deny that during the nine year of the existence of the Water Act there have be occasion when the press have think it right to report what they believe to be abuse by bureaucracy concern the water industry .many illustration immediately come to mind .I do not think it will be challenge that abuse have exist and have be bring to our attention by the press , which do a great public service , enable Members of Parliament to table question .we would not have know about many of these matter have it not be for the vigilance of the press , particularly the local press , in report they .those of we who have be on the receiving end of press comment which we do not like often have cause to smart .in our more sober and rational moment we appreciate that it be vital in a democratic system that the press should have access to meeting .

16408-1983-01-19.7.2.104.1-conservative	with today 's communication and sophisticated market , no control regime can for long prevent movement of fund in and out of a major international currency such as sterling .when we abolish exchange control in 1979 , we remove a bureaucracy of 750 people in the public sector and an administrative burden on industry that have become ineffective and without purpose .the last prop of the right hon .Gentleman 's policy collapse .it be apparently impossible to square the circle .

18009-1983-01-21.3.1.8.11-conservative	after a general election , the Government might be tempt to deal with salmon by group the river together , increase the size of the district fishery board and place the administration of local fishery in the hand of a civil servant , who will merely draw a nice salary and increase bureaucracy .that would not be the right way to proceed .it would not be any good for our salmon fishery .subject to try to give some say to district fishery board , I hope that the Bill will make speedy progress on to the statute book .

19420-1983-01-28.3.1.41.2-liberal	I anticipate a possible criticism .some people be rightly desperately frightened of add to Britain 's appalling bureaucracy .they may ask why we should add another audit when the public body be already efficiently audit by professional firm .the success of an audit depend on the angle from which the auditor be require to look and the instruction for the scope of their work .only a foolish auditor would accept the audit even of a tennis club without precise instruction as to the kind of audit that his client be ask he to perform .

10115-1983-02-15.3.4.4.1-conservative	I can give an assurance on the last point .we be propose to reduce bureaucracy and administration and release resource for service development .at the moment fpc be responsible direct to the Secretary of State for the administration of the service .our legislation will enable they to employ their own staff direct and be responsible for their own management .we believe that that will lead to more efficient administration , which will release yet more money for an improvement in service .

18333-1983-02-16.8.13.21.6-conservative	as the right hon .member for Deptford ( Mr. Silkin ) say , the Bill involve a clash of rival philosophy .when conservative member talk about public ownership , we mean individual and worker own share in enterprise , as have happen so successfully in the National Freight Corporation .when the Opposition talk about public ownership , they mean that when they be in government they will get their clammy hand on some of the major part of our industry .they mean industry be run by bureaucracy and by the Civil Service .they call that public ownership , but it be really ownership and control by official , vested interest and small cabal .it be manipulation by those with political interest close to their heart .thing be do in local constituency because they believe that they will benefit in those constituency at the next election .

10115-1983-02-17.10.1.2.5-conservative	the second objective be to improve child 's service , ensure adequate safeguard for those who be most vulnerable or at risk .thirdly , the Bill aim to get the maximum amount of patient care out of the grow resource make available to we by reduce bureaucracy and increase efficiency and effectiveness .the fourth aim be to improve the quality of decision - making and the independence of decision and appeal in the difficult area of national insurance and social security benefit claim .
10115-1983-02-17.10.1.32.7-conservative	the administrative dependence of fpc on dha have cause problem of delegation and accountability and have lead to the creation of an unnecessarily complex bureaucracy .therefore , in future , if the House approve the Bill , the Secretaries of State will establish the committee and appoint their chairman , vice - chairman and other member .we intend to consult fully on nomination and preserve the traditional balance between contractor and non - contractor within the committee .

17319-1983-02-17.10.1.37.1-labour	surely this measure will add to , rather than decrease , the bureaucracy , which be the recommendation of the Royal Commission .can not the Minister see that point , and also that it will be much more difficult for joint planning if one have such a separately constitute body ?will there not be more centralisation and more decision take by the Secretary of State ?surely we wish to get away from that in the Health Service .it be staggering that the Minister should put forward such a proposal .
10115-1983-02-17.10.1.46.2-conservative	the Bill receive a broad welcome in the other place and it contain many enlightened social reform and change in the administration of the social security system .I hope that we shall not hear from the hon .Member for Crewe ( Mrs. Dunwoody ) or from anyone else that the Bill be controversial .I be tell at one stage that the Opposition would vote against the Bill on Second Reading as a matter of principle .the liberal party have already pledge its support and the Social Democrats appear to be quite happy .the hon .Lady 's reaction to most of our policy proposal be so predictable that I fear that , if she be not careful , she will bounce up to vote against this measure before she have thoroughly reflect upon the worthwhile change that we have make .I wait to hear what lie behind any anger that Opposition Members may feel , and I hope that it be not simply their objection to the new arrangement for the family practitioner committee .that be an argument about management and how good to reduce bureaucracy and be not the main point of the Bill .
22191-1983-02-17.10.1.73.14-conservative	part v , cover the organisation of the National Health Service , be the one part of the Bill where I be not as confident as the Government about the merit of their proposal .I listen carefully to what my hon .and learn Friend the Minister have to say about this part of the Bill .I understand and share the Government 's objective .I agree that we should try as far as possible in the Health Service to simplify bureaucracy , that we should try to improve efficiency and accountability and that we should help collaboration within the Health Service for the benefit of patient care .
22191-1983-02-17.10.1.73.15-conservative	I support the Government 's object , but I must put a question to they .the Royal Commission recommend that family practitioner committee should be abolish and integrate with the health authority .would not abolition of family practitioner committee simplify bureaucracy ?surely that would reduce bureaucracy .
16401-1983-02-21.6.1.106.3-conservative	another reason for our uneasy relationship be the demand of the CAP .a number of hon .member also find the constitutional issue extremely difficult , even after 10 year of membership .however , we sign a treaty that set up a common fund and also an elect body to supervise the way in which the bureaucracy which determine the spending of the common fund manage its affair .those who oppose the signing of the treaty be entitle to their view , which be that the solution to the budgetary problem be to withdraw from the Community .the Government take a different view , and I be glad that they do .
22551-1983-02-24.8.1.37.7-conservative	the other constitutional point be that we be create a quango .my hon .friend the Member for Welwyn and Hatfield ( Mr. Murphy ) mention that .it be healthy to get rid of quango if they be superfluous , as some of they undoubtedly be , but it be perfectly healthy to transfer work from part of the Civil Service to a machinery that be more devolve and which , for that reason , have more flexibility and more freedom from all the bureaucracy of the Civil Service .I do not use that word in a pejorative sense , but if something be directly part of the Civil Service it be subject to all the financial control of that body , and the fact that there be a Minister answerable in Parliament , and so on , lead to more paperwork than one would want in a new devolve authority .
19169-1983-02-24.9.1.2.4-conservative	the transfer of formal responsibility for their upper airspace back to member state should make it easy for state which have hold back until now to join the organisation .this will be beneficial both to they and to we .the transfer of responsibility for the whole of national airspace to Eurocontrol would have result in an enlarged bureaucracy with supranational power which would have be costly in manpower and money .
10565-1983-02-25.4.1.43.1-conservative	the debate be about the homeless and multiple occupied property .the Bill be clearly try to improve matter and that be laudable and commendable .but will it do what it profess to do ?I be sceptical about local authority be give more power .I be sceptical about local authority take on more rule and regulation .I be sceptical about inspector and register .I do not believe that they will solve the problem .on the contrary , the evidence suggest that few problem be solve by more law .I be convince that the less bureaucracy and the few rule there be the few problem there will be .
10565-1983-02-25.4.1.49.2-conservative	I be argue that the relaxation of the Rent Acts would produce more accommodation , with certain protection .my second argument be that the Government be right to sell council house to owner - occupier .that be a significant first step .however , there be perhaps a more important second step which the Government may consider in the next , if not in this , Parliament .I refer to the liberalisation of council house regime .that do not mean another Act , more public money , more office or bureaucracy , but quite the opposite .it mean release the vacant housing stock that be currently waste away in public ownership .there be 300,000 council unit lie empty all over Britain .they be build with taxpayer ' and ratepayer ' money .furthermore , 20,000 of they have be lie empty for more than a year .why ?council blame the Government , say they have insufficient resource to make the necessary repair and that until the house be fit to live in people can not move in .
19206-1983-03-01.10.1.50.1-labour	I will not follow the hon .member for Lewes ( Mr. Rathbone ) too far , but I would say to he that if there be a reduction in the number of elect representative there be always a danger of the growth of bureaucracy .I also remind he that in the United States , although they may have few representative , those representative have a huge support staff .be that what he be suggest for this country and for this House ?he may very well have to make a choice between the two .but , as his right hon .friend the Home Secretary say , this be perhaps not a matter for this debate but for some future debate — I hope the very distant future .

18560-1983-03-15.8.22.2.10-conservative	I do not exaggerate the strain that such intolerable administrative burden place on the small employer .I have an extract from a scottish newspaper of 11 September 1980 .that quote 16 small business man as say that their business be up for sale because of Government red tape .the small employer have enough to battle with in this time of recession without have to take on the machinery of bureaucracy , especially when it appear that the machinery be gear against he .therefore , I ask the Minister to take step to simplify the procedure , not only by remove some of the major disincentive but by offer some positive incentive .the EC 's suggestion that an allowance might be give towards the cost incur by small and medium sized firm in comply with tax and other regulation be one possibility .
22050-1983-03-16.9.1.102.5-conservative	my hon .friend the Member for Horsham and Crawley ( Mr. Hordern ) speak about the growth in the number of Government servant .it be not for I to comment on the National Health Service , but in Customs and Excise and Inland Revenue , total number of staff have be reduce by 14,000 since the Government come to office .that be a decline of 13 per cent.—an achievement which I be sure my hon .friend will recognise as an example of good management and curtailment of bureaucracy .I hope that he will pay tribute where tribute be due to those in the public service who have establish more efficient working practice .
18893-1983-03-21.11.1.40.4-labour	the press say that the Budget be boring .we can all bear what the press say on these matter .we in the Opposition regard it as irrelevant to the main aim of stop de - industrialisation and return to full employment .we do not need to look for our salvation to eastern Europe with its bureaucracy , or to Reaganomic United States with its free market force .Britain need to do something in the international economic scene , and this will be deal with later .at home we can be our own economic schoolmaster , as we be in 1944 , but we must relearn the lesson of the 1944 White Paper and update it to meet today 's problem .the Government must lead in the fight to deal with unemployment .the Government 's policy palpably do not deal with unemployment , the fall in industrial production and the large number of bankruptcy .this Budget be irrelevant to the need of the community .
18333-1983-03-21.14.1.27.4-conservative	I notice that between 1976 and 1981 expenditure on the Commission — the bureaucracy — double , expenditure on the common agricultural policy double , expenditure on the regional and social fund , from which we be say to benefit more , treble , though it be still puny , and expenditure on the european assembly quadruple and far outstrip increase expenditure on any other institution or fund in the Community .
22588-1983-03-22.9.1.119.2-conservative	for that reason , I agree with the final part of the motion , and especially the part that refer to an independent , highly efficient and profitable engineering company .that come ill from Socialists whose policy have destroy thousand of such company and whose nationalisation have destroy any sense of independence .they have impose highly centralise bureaucracy , usually in London , through protection of the state monopoly against the possibility of competition from independent company , which would expose their inefficiency and improve customer service , and through taxation , which have drive so many private company into the arm of the multiple and the multinational .

21956-1983-03-23.9.37.17.2-social_democratic_party	it be right to spend a little time discuss repair , especially for local authority housing .all hon .member who represent area with large number of council property know that that issue be one of the major cause of frustration among council tenant .they be annoy most of all by the bureaucracy of the operation of local authority .I be not make a political point — it affect local authority of all political persuasion .
21956-1983-03-23.9.37.17.5-social_democratic_party	how will such problem be help by the approach lay down in clause 21 , and the amendment that have be propose ?there be two separate approach to the problem .the Government believe that the whole operation of repair should be private from the start .once the council have approve the repair , the tenant be on his own .he can do the repair himself , bring in a firm to do whatever he wish .it be a private arrangement .however , it still involve council bureaucracy .the council must still examine the problem , agree that a repair be necessary , decide what sort of repair be involve and what the cost will be so that the tenant know how much he can spend .the tenant have to find a contractor .the Government 's approach do not provide for any approved list of contractor .the tenant can give the work to someone that he have pick out of the advertisement in the weekly paper .
22582-1983-03-23.9.51.2.1-labour	this amendment seek to ensure that plan will be submit to a local authority when final certification be give , not just when the work revert to the local authority .the Minister 's argument that there be excessive bureaucracy be false , because , as my hon .friend the Member for Edmonton ( Mr. Graham ) say , at present the local authority act as a depository for information about building within its boundary .
10537-1983-03-28.12.2.23.2-conservative	I be not one who denigrate the court ' role .I believe that our freedom and liberty be defend and preserve by our access to the court .I recognise , perhaps not in sympathy with most hon .member , that as our society evolve , our confidence in institution be erode and our confidence in the decision of bureaucracy and in ministerial fiat diminish , we shall increasingly seek reference to the court for the defence of our liberty and of our property .therefore , I consider new clause 5 to present an extremely important concept .
22579-1983-03-29.9.3.40.6-conservative	I believe that it would be wrong and discriminatory for British Telecom to retain a monopoly in the cable business .I believe that it would be against the national interest when compete in the technological revolution , and that there would be no likelihood of success in the cable business because there would be the minimum of risk - taking and innovation and the maximum amount of bureaucracy .
18333-1983-03-29.10.1.45.4-conservative	I be a supporter of the Bill .I appreciate the difficulty that my hon .friend have have .we be break new ground and we be move forward with speed .we be go into new and uncharted territory .it be a very difficult thing for a Government to do .I think that the Government have do the good they can in very difficult circumstance .the reason that the Bill be important — as my hon .friend say it be the most important bit of legislation in this session — be that since 1945 large chunk of british life and industry have be take away from the private sector and the people and put under public bureaucracy .
18333-1983-03-29.10.1.45.5-conservative	much of our industry and many of our people now work within the public sector .other people work within the private sector .one part of our commercial and industrial life be responsive to the need of the public and the market and be efficient , profitable and flexible , whereas a whole raft of other activity suffer from bureaucracy , lack of competition and lack of commercial discipline .one of the sad effect of this be that for those who work in the public sector , although they may be force to work in a relatively inefficient way and although at the moment there may be more people actually do work than need be there to do the work , it be a very unsatisfactory working environment in which people have commit their life .
16651-1983-03-30.16.1.40.4-conservative	the debate have highlight the problem which properly concern hon .member because we be the guardian and keeper of the reputation of the House , and orderly and disorderly conduct bear upon that .but let there be no misunderstanding .the original Standing Orders date back to the last century , when behaviour in the House be infinitely more disorderly than it be today .there have be seven suspension in this Parliament — just under two a year .I do not speak with any complacency or plead that in extenuation , but I suspect that , in an assembly where debate and conduct have inevitably tend to be a good deal more lively than in some other assembly , we strike a balance among the various component of debate , include that of noise and disorder , which be historically integral to the conduct of our affair .I suspect that we do that as well today as we have do at any time in generation past .I will not argue with my hon .friend the Member for Tiverton ( Mr. Maxwell - Hyslop ) because he will sense that he have more robust criticism of his speech from other than from I .in response to the point make by the hon .member for Newham , South ( Mr. Spearing ) , should the new Standing Orders be confirm this evening , they will become effective as soon as the resolution be agree to .I make a reference of gratitude to the hon .member for Islington , South and Finsbury ( Mr. Cunningham ) .I doubt whether the revise Standing Orders in their pristine and pure exposition of language will stand alongside Milton or Shakespeare but to have do something to improve the language in the essential bureaucracy of this place be , indeed , an achievement .I congratulate he on that point .
18366-1983-03-31.3.9.16.1-conservative	I hope that the hon .member for Lewisham , West ( Mr. Price ) will survive any catastrophe that might overtake the country .there be proposal for the regional government of the country in the event of an attack that make central government no long possible .I think that the country would hope and expect that to be the case .the idea that the bureaucracy , and even Ministers , will be protect uniformly in such circumstance be nonsense .
21900-1983-03-31.11.1.2.15-conservative	with regard to diplomatic support , the report reach a most significant conclusion .it be that the soviet outpost in southern Africa in the 1980 and the african bureaucracy in Moscow be now man by experienced specialist of a calibre that do not even exist during Russia 's first major foray into Africa 20 year ago .I should like to know whether the Minister think that we should take the most serious note of that conclusion .
22244-1983-04-11.9.1.2.12-conservative	for these reason , the Government have restrict their Bill to automatically process datum .to do otherwise would require a monstrous bureaucracy and place intolerable burden on user — and even then there would be grave doubt about whether it would be enforceable .it would certainly require a scheme totally different from that contain in this Bill .let we not overreach ourselves unnecessarily , and , in the process , lose the benefit of what be at this time within our grasp .
22244-1983-04-11.9.1.4.7-conservative	in provide for a registrar with a supervisory function of this kind we have have to strike a delicate balance .on the one hand , there be the risk of set up a cumbersome bureaucracy , continuously at the heel of legitimate business activity and impede technological development .on the other hand , we must guard against the registrar be ineffective , lack the power and resource to give any tooth to the legislation .the Government do not want some vast new quango that will jeopardise efficiency in every area of national life : thus we have go for a compact organisation which will not interfere unnecessarily .the burden on law - abide datum user will be keep to a minimum .on the other hand , it be nonsense to suggest that the registrar will be ineffective when the need for action arise .we have say that his staff will be quite small , but it will be adequate to deal with abuse when they occur .experience from Europe show that a large staff be not need for this purpose .what matter be the role to be perform and the power available to carry it out .

10469-1983-05-06.5.3.14.1-conservative	I accept that what my hon .friend have suggest would be an improvement .I be worried that the amount of legislation and bureaucracy necessary to collect a relatively small sum would be disproportionate to the advantage .at the end of the first year there would need to be a follow - up and people would need to check .it would be too easy to take the collar off the dog and say that it no long belong to one and kick it out on to the street mile away from home .that be why I be worried about the hardship that the increase in the licence fee could bring to animal as well as the disproportionate cost of collect the money .we should put the responsibility for the behaviour and control of animal where it belong — on the owner .that be why I should like to see the penalty enforce more vigorously .

16408-1984-05-08.15.3.18.5-conservative	turn to the actual programme provision , the House will appreciate that , since neither the BBC nor the IBA as such will be responsible for provide the service , if it be to fit into our pattern of broadcasting arrangement , some responsible joint body will have to be bring into being .that will require another addition to the Bill .but I do not intend that the creation of this joint body , to bear responsibility for the transmission of the programme and for their standard and content , should involve a large new bureaucracy .I envisage that its member will be draw equally from the BBC 's board of governor and the member of the IBA .it must have a separate statutory existence , since its responsibility be not precisely the same as those of either of the exist broadcasting authority ; but , nevertheless , I believe that the board 's activity can be view as a logical extension of those of both the BBC and the IBA .the standard which the service will be require to meet will be those which would apply to a service under part ii of the Bill .
16595-1984-05-09.6.3.37.1-conservative	will the hon .gentleman address the most important subject of all to most of we — what be to happen to the function that the authority be abandon ?do he agree that the great problem be that , although these function will go to so - call elect body , the body will not be directly elect but will be nominate and the democratic process will become tenuous and bureaucracy will become heavy ?many of we do not support the metropolitan county when they be set up , and we be now worried that all the function that be lop from the great city be not go back to they .it would alter the opposition of many of we if the police and fire service go back to the authority whence they come , and which they discharge very efficiently .will the hon .gentleman tackle that question ?
10123-1984-05-09.6.3.220.2-labour	throughout , the Secretary of State have say that remove a tier of government will mean automatic saving for local government , but that be not true .he argue that before when , as Secretary of State for Social Services , he abolish the area health authority .he argue then that that would cut a tier of government and automatically reduce bureaucracy and expenditure .but on 14 November 1983 , the Under - Secretary of State for Health and Social Security , in reply to a Conservative Member , admit that the number of full - time administrative and clerical staff in the NHS have rise by 600 nationally between September 1981 and June 1983 , or during and after the period of reorganisation .therefore , the Secretary of State can not argue that get rid of a tier automatically mean more saving .the opposite be often true , as one find more and more bureaucrat in these proliferate quango .the real evidence be to be find in the Coopers and Lybrand report .that be the only detailed study that we know of , unless the Department have do something .the good summary of the cost argument can be find in the Surveyor magazine .
22582-1984-05-09.7.1.10.3-labour	Greater Manchester council be adamant that the proposal , if implement , will lead to great cost , reduce service and more bureaucracy and will take we far down the sinister path to increase centralism .
22490-1984-05-09.7.1.19.2-conservative	the hon .member for Newham , North - West attack the report from the four London treasurer .one can certainly argue that some of the figure in that report be base upon assumption about rate support grant distribution which perhaps it be too early to confirm , but that study undoubtedly show that there would be substantial administrative saving of about £ 35 million .that be consistent with what I say early .there must be saving from the elimination of the GLC bureaucracy .
19420-1984-05-10.6.9.6.4-liberal	when I be first elect a Member of Parliament , the West Riding county council , which be then the operative body , extend from the hinterland of Morecambe bay in the west to the mouth of the Humber in the east .because of its enormous resource , and because it have rich farming country in the north , and coalmine — indeed , the centre of the british coal industry — in the south , with much manufacturing in between , it be able to recruit the most distinguished public servant .one of my great pleasure in early year here be to go to various Departments of state with the almost omnipotent clerk , as he be then call , of the West Riding county council , accompany by three party leader , all of great experience and knowledge .those people , in my humble presence , terrified Ministers , who be change office every year or so , and permanent secretary alike .I feel a tremendous thrill , not to be play any great part , but to be present when the people from my part of the country be inspire awe and respect in the bureaucracy of Whitehall .
10036-1984-05-15.9.3.83.3-labour	we be not deal with those who will be charge , detain , and bring to trial for serious arrestable offence .we be try to defend the individual who walk into a police station seek to help the police with their inquiry .he be face with a new bureaucracy , which begin with the custody officer , and then proceed to the review officer and the superintendent .there be a whole host of code of practice for treatment , questioning and identification of the person suspect of the crime .we be deal with the sort of person to whom the hon .Member for Derby , North refer , who at the end of the day walk free from detention .
10036-1984-05-15.9.7.19.2-labour	we be not seek to create another empire within the bureaucracy .we be not try to create an authority which would of its own accord go all over the place to investigate a series of matter which be beyond its purview and its power of investigation .we feel that an indpendent authority should have the right to investigate case of death or injury .this be base on my personal knowledge of what happen in county Durham .
10036-1984-05-15.9.7.19.5-labour	the Bill be not perfect and do not meet the criterion which we believe can be meet only by an independent body .I do not see why we can not move towards such independence as a matter of principle .we seek wide public confidence in the police and a proper complaint procedure .such a procedure should not be hamper by police bureaucracy .it should be handle by an independent body .
16827-1984-05-15.9.7.30.1-conservative	I be grateful to the hon .and learn Member for that information .however , the Police Federation have accept that only up to a point .what concern I more be who will be on the board that the hon .and learn Gentleman be suggest , and what kind of experience such people will have .it seem to be the case that new clause 19(10 ) will create too many tier of bureaucracy .I want to see expert not talker , worker not stirrer , and that will not be the result if the new clause be pass .
10327-1984-05-16.8.1.7.2-labour	the Bill do not clarify the duty of the police .it impose a mountain of bureaucracy on a force that be hard - press in any case .it impose duty with regard to the training of , for example , custody officer , though it provide no more money .indeed , the rate support grant provision will affect the police badly .
19964-1984-05-16.9.1.6.16-labour	the trouble be that it be impossible to produce effective representative institution for test Hong Kong opinion in the few month still available when we have refuse to do so during the past 150 year .in any case , the real problem of democratise Hong Kong lie in make the bureaucracy more accountable to the people rather than produce a parliamentary democracy on the Westminster model , which have work in few place that do not have Anglo - Saxon political tradition and have not work anywhere in country have a majority of Chinese in their population .
10659-1984-05-16.11.1.3.3-conservative	my hon .friend also mention the need to reduce the number of housing association .it be now difficult to start a housing association and register it with the corporation , because it look hard at the number of exist association in any give area .however , there be problem if housing association become too big .if that happen , they tend to replicate the bureaucracy and the remoteness that be a problem with local authority , and often lose the personal contact and involvement of committee member with tenant and the development of the association , which be the strength of the movement .
10298-1984-05-22.11.3.67.2-liberal_democrats	my fifth point be that the professional bureaucracy that go with joint board be also unhelpful .that be where experience be most evident .the hon .Member for Langbaurgh ( Mr. Holt ) have have experience , and make a valid contribution .unless thing have change recently , in the one exceptional case of the Welsh water authority , water authority — as well as health authority — be frustrating because of the inadequacy of their accountability .we read just this week in the paper that the anglian water authority be to increase its rate by 14 per cent . , and other water authority will raise their rate by even more .they be responsible to no one .
16415-1984-05-22.11.3.71.1-labour	I should like to give another example of the bureaucratic and inefficient nature of the water authority , by refer to the North West water authority .the Bill be about establish organisation that be unaccountable and non - democratically elect , like water authority .I ask the Secretary of State for the Environment how many legal case have be bring against the North West water authority , how much it have pay in claim and in solicitor ' fee , and how many such case have be settle with and without proceeding .the answer be that the information be not available , be not keep centrally and could not be obtain from the North West water authority .that be a typical example of the bureaucracy in water authority .if they be democratically elect , the information would be available .
10298-1984-05-22.11.3.156.3-liberal_democrats	thirdly , how will the reply be standardise so that the information be provide in the way require and be intelligible to all concern ?request will be flood on to officer ' desk day after day , hour after hour , week after week , and month after month .how on earth will they do the rest of their job — the job that they be do yesterday , be do today and will do tomorrow ?they have a practical job that they be already employ to do .and the Secretary of State be charge they with enormous additional task and function .he , the great reliever of bureaucracy , the person mean to be take government of our back , be add to the burden of those employ local authority up and down the land .
10298-1984-05-22.13.1.38.2-liberal_democrats	the liberal party support amendment no .102 .if the Government be not minded to accept the amendment , why not ?the Minister will recognise the word from their own legislation in early form .they have precedent in two recent conservative Acts — section 71 of the New Towns Act 1981 , and paragraph 14 of schedule 31 of the Local Government , Planning and Land Act 1980 .in both those Acts , the method for provide information be to have a delegate officer do the job .that would reduce the red tape , bureaucracy , overlapping of command and so on .
10133-1984-05-22.13.3.67.1-labour	I thank my hon .friend for make that point .he represent part of the Finsbury Park area .it be almost a superhuman problem to try to put pressure on British Rail to improve its station and clean up the station 's facility .it be , indeed , a superhuman problem to overcome the bureaucracy of three borough council as well as deal with British Rail and the many other statutory authority .problem occur whenever an area be bisect by borough boundary .
21956-1984-05-22.13.3.132.5-social_democratic_party	in the GLC and metropolitan county area , the power which , in the rest of the country , will be exert by the county council will devolve upon the London borough and the metropolitan district .there must be considerable doubt about whether the expertise necessary to the undertaking of the important safety function will exist in those body .clearly it exist in the county council , but it may not exist at the low level .in any case , I wonder how many of the London borough contain a reservoir .I understand that there be about a hundred reservoir in Manchester , responsibility for the safety of which will devolve upon the metropolitan district in Greater Manchester .operate such power at the low tier of a two - tier system will result in extra cost , duplication and bureaucracy and , I would suggest , less effective supervision .Boroughs with reservoir will , no doubt , have to appoint reservoir safety officer and reservoir department , when the job could be do much more effectively by retain power at county level .this issue underline the Government 's shortsightedness in abolish authority that operate over a wide area and pool expertise in such technical problem .what the Government be do will not reduce cost , but rather increase they and I therefore have pleasure in commend the amendment to the Committee .
19579-1984-05-22.13.3.133.1-social_democratic_party	Amendment no .108 incorporate many of the alliance 's objection to the Bill .a new bureaucracy , in the form of joint board , will have to be establish to deal with reservoir safety .it be a prime example of the wasteful change that will result from the Bill .
19579-1984-05-22.13.3.133.3-social_democratic_party	moreover , an obvious regional responsibility be be ignore .the new administration will be responsible for reservoir that be not neatly situate in district area .they serve region and therefore responsibility for they should lie with an elect body that cover the region concern , not an appoint board .in this regard , our three objection to the Bill emerge once again — more indirect administration , more duplication and wasteful bureaucracy and regional responsibility be give to body that be not regional .
10015-1984-05-22.13.5.85.2-liberal_democrats	give the uncertain nature of the consultation , be this not another example of how the proposal will create the very thing that the Government have tell we that they be against — more bureaucracy ?it will cost more money than the exist structure .
10074-1984-05-22.13.11.11.5-liberal	a conservative Government originally introduce the metropolitan county and the GLC .I recall , although I be not then in this House , that the Prime Minister of the day , the right hon .Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup ( Mr. Heath ) , argue that it would increase the efficiency of local government and save money .the net effect of set up these authority be a great increase in local government bureaucracy and cost .but the Government can not simply say that because they cost money to set up , we should abolish they and thereby save money .
10074-1984-05-22.13.11.21.2-liberal	it be unlikely that a left - wing Labour Government could take power , because they do not have the support of the country .however , the electoral system do strange thing , and if that happen the shire county could be abolish because they be under conservative control .we need a rather more sensible democratic and think - through method of run local government than the piecemeal creation of new authority that we have 15 year ago .that create a great deal of unnecessary extra bureaucracy and cost when it be create by a Conservative Government .the Government be change the system not because that will save money , but because they fail to take political control .
19341-1984-05-22.13.17.103.1-conservative	with his usual perception , my hon .friend have put his finger right on it .the Bill 's whole purpose be to allow for the business - like transfer of the government of London from the present bureaucracy of the GLC , through the interim council , to the borough council ; the very form of local government which Mr. Livingstone — that well - know leader of the majority party in county hall — accept as the good form of local government in London in his address to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy in 1982 .
10146-1984-05-22.16.1.39.4-labour	as with the argument on finance , so with the argument about structure and function : there have be no proper inquiry , no evidence to support the Government 's assertion , and nothing which could convince even conservative Members , many of whom in their heart of heart must shudder at the probable impact of this measure — the bureaucracy involve .the anti - democratic nature of the legislation , the further accretion of power to Whitehall , all embody in this miserable little measure .
19356-1984-06-04.6.11.129.2-conservative	nevertheless , there be no escape the fact that the amendment would create another tier of bureaucracy .under present arrangement , as the right hon .Gentleman say , applicant who consider a decision to be wrong or harsh can and sometimes do appeal to Ministers or via their member of Parliament .we all know about that .all such case be reconsider centrally to ensure consistency and Ministers have to be satisfied that the decision be correct .these arrangement , which have exist for many year under government of both party , have prove satisfactory .I assume that Opposition Members believe that to be the case when they be in office because they do not seek to delegate to an outside body responsibility for the decision that be take by their official .
19356-1984-06-04.6.11.129.3-conservative	the Opposition 's argument for yet a further level of bureaucracy have not convince I of the need to change a system which work and , more importantly , which ensure the consistency vital to the operation of an automatic scheme operate on the basis of statutatory criterion and publish rule .what be more , I could not accept that if such a new system of appeal be implement , its decision should be bind on the Secretary of State .this would be inconsistent with the accountability of Ministers to Parliament for the scheme .therefore , I advise the House to reject the amendment .
10639-1984-06-04.6.11.130.3-labour	the amendment be not create an extra level of bureaucracy .it be use a level that exist already .when it come to fairness and equity , we have to be ready to accept a marginal inconvenience to Ministers to ensure that there be see to be even handedness .it be understandable that outside the House people may he less than happy with the judgment of the people who frame the Bill in the first place , and their ability to sit as adjudicator be hardly enhance by their record in recent month .
19579-1984-06-04.6.11.131.2-social_democratic_party	I hope that the Minister will reconsider .it be inevitable that anxiety will be feel when such a wide degree of discretion be give to Ministers .I accept what the Minister say about the amendment building in another tier of bureaucracy .no one want that if it can be avoid .but it may be that the advisory procedure that be adopt on the selective section of the 1972 Act could be apply to this legislation .that would provide at least a degree of independent view on the discretion be exercise by Ministers .whether we should go as far as the amendment propose and provide a right of appeal , I be not sure .but to have some independent voice in the system because of the increase power be give to Ministers would be welcome by people in industry who feel that neither civil servant nor Ministers understand industry in the way that they should .to have the voice of industry in the form of the advisory board would work effectively .
16403-1984-06-04.6.11.132.8-labour	we be deal with a different matter here .one man 's judgment , that of the Secretary of State , be set against the judgment of the applicant , and there be no appeal .it have be say that my amendment would create more bureaucracy .I be astonish at the unfettered power that this be give to bureaucrat .these decision in the generality of case will not be take by Ministers .they will never pass over a Minister 's desk , unless some of the judgment give rise to so many complaint that Ministers will be force to look at they .these will be decision of bureaucrat against businessman .the Government be suppose to be support businessman , but the Bill be a bureaucrat 's paradise .some kind of independent judgment will have to be exercise in case of dispute , with the ultimate authority rest with the Secretary of State , which I do not dispute .the Minister 's reply be extraordinary .
16422-1984-06-05.8.9.42.4-conservative	let we assume that the registrar receive many return from datum user , show that they make disclosure to police force for crime prevention purpose in respect of one or 100 individual in a particular category .how will that assist the registrar ?he be as likely to hear of abuse of the non - disclosure exemption without the propose new bureaucracy as he be with it .when he hear of abuse , he be fully empower to investigate it .
10464-1984-06-05.9.3.19.1-labour	there be scottish fisherman other than those who operate from the east coast .such fisherman might not be involve in that committee .fishing be a dangerous occupation and accident be possible , even with the high safety standard .it do no harm constantly to remind crew and skipper of the danger .this brief debate will be read closely by the industry because it have be watch the Bill 's progress .we feel it appropriate to raise the issue of safety once again .we realise that there be little enthusiasm among conservative member for it now and be disapponte by that .this be a modest proposal that be concern with only a limited area of activity in the fishing industry .it could be a testing ground for specialised advisory committee on safety throughout the United Kingdom 's water .we do not envisage a massive bureaucracy or quango because the people who would be call upon to participate in such a committee give their time freely with the same commitment that they give to their other worthwhile activity in regard to the fishing industry .
22593-1984-06-05.9.15.43.4-conservative	I know that my hon .friend will be pleased to hear that Ministries in Scotland and England be treat the matter seriously and be examine way in which to resolve some of the difficulty .any salmon tagging scheme must be cost effective in the broad sense .it would be most unfortunate if we end up with a tagging scheme that cause much bureaucracy and administration and do not prevent poaching .any scheme must be watertight in that regard .
10659-1984-06-12.11.1.100.1-conservative	it may be convenient if I intervene at this stage to outline the Government 's attitude to the Bill and to the instruction .I begin by echo what be say by my hon .friend the Member for Enfield .Southgate ( Sir A. Berry ) in commend the speech of the hon .member for Holborn and St. Pancras ( Mr. Dobson ) .how the hon .member for Holborn and St. pancra manage to reconcile his tribute to county hall today with the view he express a few year ago that it be the slow bureaucracy this side of the Kremlin be a matter between he and his conscience .
10171-1984-06-12.11.1.101.1-labour	if the Minister be to consider that that remark be pass at the time I be try to get Sir Horace Cutler 's lousy , slow and awful GLC to start do improvement on the Ossulston estate in my constituency , which it have fail to do for year , he would understand why I be doubtful whether there be a bureaucracy even the other side of the Kremlin as bad as that run by Sir Horace Cutler .
10276-1984-06-18.9.1.5.14-conservative	the lesson for we be clear .we must recognise that we be deal with a cautious but calculate leadership — a leadership obsess with the security of their state but disregard the threat which soviet power pose to other .their system be premise on the certainty of the eventual ideological triumph of Communism , but it will proceed carefully towards that goal .opportunity will be grasp , but only if the price be acceptable .it be a bureaucracy which , by its nature , be slow move , lead by man whose whole experience be to play thing long .we can not expect to make rapid progress in negotiation with the Soviet Union , but equally we must persevere , and we must articulate to western public opinion why meaningful and lasting agreement with the Warsaw pact can be achieve only as a result of hard , slow and patient negotiation conduct from a position of strength .it would be folly to encourage unrealistic hope of easy and rapid progress which can not be fulfil .
17660-1984-06-19.8.1.40.5-conservative	before people start attack the proposal , they should know what they be about .the scale of the increase in defence spending that we have undertake — from the time we come to power to 1986 it will be 23 per cent .in real term — cannot be justify unless we ensure that we be get the good value for money .those increase resource should not go into more bureaucracy or more top brass for the Ministry .they should go , not into the system , but into the fighting effectiveness of our armed force .
10127-1984-06-22.2.3.42.3-conservative	on 17 June an article in the business column of the Observer say that my right hon .friend the Secretary of State can hardly hand out BA 's route network ( its effective growth factor ) with one hand and expect share offer to the public with the other to attract a stampede .the Daily Express say : plan to privatise British Airways could be ground even before they hit the runway if the Government take away some of the airline 's profitable route .the Daily Express be absolutely right .conservative member want to see British Airways set free , able to conduct its affair without the stifling hand of bureaucracy .the reason be clear .first , the customer will benefit from further improvement in service .secondly , the nation will gain as British Airways ' considerable overseas earning — more than £ 500 million a year net gain to invisible earning — increase as the airline grow .thirdly , there will be the benefit of the example to the nation of the great turnround achieve under the new management that my right hon .friend the Prime Minister have put in .
19152-1984-06-25.11.5.24.5-labour	we must remember that the ticket system might well go beyond London Transport .we have talk about the need to integrate British Rail service with those of London Transport and , ideally , their ticketing system should have some compatibility .I be not suggest that they should be the same , because both authority provide different sort of service .there have be conversation , investigation , memoranda and meeting galore over the past three or four year on this topic and the bureaucracy of both place have seem not to be especially practical .unless future ticket arrangement between British Rail and London Transport be clear and pilot scheme have be show to work , the future ticket regime of the system can not be say to be clear and settle .
10679-1984-06-26.7.72.4.10-democratic_unionist_party	small firm be adversely affect by the time - consume burden of training return .it be appreciate that there be a need for such information , which form the basis for educate policy and planning decision , but I sympathise with the frustration feel by small business man and woman who be oblige to deal with the demand of bureaucracy , which unfortunately divert their attention from the task of build up their firm and ensure that they continue to function .
22441-1984-06-26.7.72.7.4-conservative	the right hon .and learn Gentleman be also concerned about a lessening of the statutory sector .his socialist approach would , of course , always prefer the maximum amount of bureaucracy .if adequate training can be bring about without the necessity for statutory board , surely even he would prefer thereby to forgo the administrative cost , which could be up to 20 per cent .of the whole , just for the sake of some bureaucratic interference .
10197-1984-06-28.11.2.129.3-labour	my fifth reason should again obtain the support a hon .member on both side of the House .if we be concerned to have a springboard to freedom so that people can build their own little paradise without central bureaucracy put its big sticky finger in , child benefit be the benefit to go for .
17223-1984-07-03.9.1.36.4-conservative	it be true , however , that one can not deny or disguise the fact that the new quota arrangement be a matter of anxiety for our dairy industry .in some respect , it be for the United Kingdom an unsatisfactory system for deal with an undoubted problem m the European Community .however one look at it , the system be arbitrary , capricious in its effect , distort the market , and will establish a new bureaucracy and control apparatus at a time when the general thrust of Government policy be in the opposite direction .it favour the large producer at the expense of the small .on that subject , incidentally , United Kingdom milk producer decline in number from some 150,000 in 1960 to 53,000 in 1983 — almost 100,000 few .that be a shocking statistic to those of we who believe in the ever - widen diffusion of ownership .
18333-1984-07-04.10.4.22.6-conservative	I have suggest previously — I hope that my hon .friend the Minister will say something about this when he reply — that as the problem be different in different part of the country local people may wish to deal with the problem differently , and instead of a great central system , which would involve additional bureaucracy and tax , we should , within guideline , let each local authority decide on its own system and dog licence fee .the money so raise should be spend on the control and welfare of dog .
16413-1984-07-05.4.1.13.1-conservative	have my right hon .friend notice that the GLC have vote £ 6 million to clothe the wolf Livingstone in sheep 's clothing ?will she take this opportunity — and do so continually — to explain to the country that the abolition of an insensitive and expensive tier of bureaucracy will increase local democracy and accountability ?
10212-1984-07-05.7.2.70.2-conservative	there be plainly a great deal more to manage the Health Service than simply spend money on an ever - expand bureaucracy .it mean look carefully and critically at all the service we provide to see how we can provide they well .it mean constant and continue effort to cut cost and cut out waste .it mean translate a big share of available resource into direct patient care .
18656-1984-07-06.13.2.17.10-labour	I disagree with the method suggest by the hon .member for Bridgend for application for cl .at the moment , whichever club be involve , it police the system .it have discretion whether to issue a CL licence .the hon .Gentleman propose that the organisation must give write notification to the local authority .the Association of District Councils do not ask for that .it do not want that addition to bureaucracy , but the Caravan Club would agree that where a local authority ask that it should always be give write authority , that would be do .that be fair enough .
21735-1984-07-06.13.2.19.7-conservative	anyone involve in such pursuit outside the House must view the Bill with some anxiety .I shall not defend or criticise my hon .Friend 's Bill , which be a private Member 's Bill , but the Government be anxious to approach it constructively .it be not our intention , as some of my hon .friend say , to introduce more bureaucracy .the intention be to introduce some unification , which be an important feature of my hon .friend 's speech .as the right hon .Member for Halton and my hon .friend the Member for Bridgend say , the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 bring touring as well as static caravan under a new form of licensing control while leave tent camping to continue to be license in England and Wales under the Public Health Act 1936 .
21735-1984-07-06.13.2.23.12-conservative	it be clear that all of we dislike bureaucracy , and farmer be no exception to that .many have argue that farmer dislike bureaucracy so much that they will not even bother to apply for a site licence .that be not likely to happen except in a small minority of case .it may happen in some case , but it will be sporadic .

16500-1984-07-09.10.1.13.16-conservative	the first reason be that our sport good trade tend to be dissipate among a large number of small company which seldom combine to afford effective trade opportunity .secondly , the various Government Departments charge with the task of assist and develop trade link form a maze of bureaucracy which those involve in the sport trade have difficulty in negotiate .thirdly , the varied Government Departments which have the opportunity for create trade with other country in sport good and facility themselves sometimes appear not to be work in harmony .we need a co - ordinated committee to develop that aspect .with the increase of leisure and the increase universality of sophisticated sport facility and equipment , that aspect could prove vital to Britain 's trade prospect .

10034-1984-07-20.4.1.53.3-liberal_democrats	an alternative which the Government could have accept would be to accept the review body 's original recommendation , have the 39p as an absolute maximum and hope that hon .member would not rush to claim the maximum figure .another advantage of that be that the system be propose will be expensive to operate .the banding system and the need to submit much more complicated form will cause much bureaucracy ; indeed , it would not be an exaggeration to say that it would require about three more member of staff in the Fees Office , at a cost of about £ 20,000 a year , to carry out that work .I have some sympathy with the Government 's belief that they have to go far to ensure that justice be see to be do and that there be no possibility of claim at the wrong rate , but I believe that the banding system be wrong .

19732-1984-11-06.3.8.53.5-conservative	I want to cite briefly a matter that be cause vexation and difficulty in my constituency at the moment .a few week ago , the Greater Manchester council decide , without any consultation so far as I be able to ascertain , certainly not with the local district councillor and certainly not with the Stockport council , to put down some double yellow line on the main Stockport road through the town of Romiley .it so happen that do that will affect the livelihood of a large number of trader .naturally , they be up in arm about a proposal about which they have not be consult .I cite that example because it be all too typical of the way in which the Greater Manchester council have behave over many year .time and again we have find that overlap jurisdiction , interference and bureaucracy have serve to divorce the Greater Manchester council from the people whom it be mean to serve .
10146-1984-11-07.7.1.30.5-labour	it be also unacceptable to the Opposition that the dangerous and accelerate trend of the past five year of elect local council become the control agent of a central bureaucracy should continue .be we expect to live in a society where more and more power be remove from democratically elect council and give to non - elect unaccountable elite , as have happen in the administration of the Health Service , the water industry , transport and other such as the fire service and refuse disposal ?that seem to be the fate of much of the work now be carry out by the metropolitan county and the GLC .
17769-1984-11-07.7.1.108.2-conservative	local authority should examine those area of their operation to find where they can obtain the good and cheap service form the private sector .those area include refuse collection , street cleaning , garden and park maintenance , social service laundry maintenance , vehicle maintenance and housing maintenance .they should invite tender for the performance of those service and accept the low tender submit .local authority must provide value for money and must not behave like municipal Prussians .they must not be insensitive to local view and demand or run vast bureaucracy whose vested interest be self - expansion .
19964-1984-11-09.5.1.24.16-labour	I hope that that will open the eye of Government and bureaucracy to the urgency of the problem .I do not deny that the problem be overwhelmingly difficult and complex .as Lord Cameron write in the Times , there be an urgent need to set up permanent contingency arrangement for emergency action in case of extreme tragedy , such as that in Ethiopia .we must hold massive stock of food on the spot in area likely to be subject to famine .we know that those stock exist ; they have be maintain at enormous cost by member of the European Community .there be a cry need for agricultural development , and there be a cry need to give the country where climate , or the poverty of the land , offer no prospect of they feed themselves , the mean to earn money with which to buy the food that they need .
22183-1984-11-12.5.1.8.1-conservative	why should one more penny of british taxpayer ' money go to a bloated international bureaucracy , which be incompetent and highly political , waste a great deal of money and be hostile to the West in general and to Britain in particular ?can not some way be find to give the money to Ethiopia instead ?
19735-1984-11-12.9.1.62.10-conservative	minister have no power to overrule award by a wage council , with the result that the employer be discourage from employ a young person .potential employee , therefore , remain in the dole queue .it be an example of the Government be so hedge about by bureaucracy that often the scheme be of no use to those for whom they be intend .the barrier in the example that I citie be 5p .it would be laughable if it be not so serious for the young people who find themselves exclude from the scheme .
18853-1984-11-14.9.2.5.10-conservative	turn to the future , we must look to the multilateral agency , and in particular the European Community , for the kind of assistance that can help avert further disaster .the pattern of negotiation agree under the lomé convention enable the Community to achieve the right context for aid much more effectively than could be do by a single donor .the pragmatic approach take by the Ethiopean Government to famine relief make I hope that a similar approach can be adopt to long - term agricultural development .I understand that the late discussion between the Government of Ethiopia and the World Bank have show encouraging sign of that .the problem of Ethiopia have to be see in the context of famine and the threat of famine elsewhere in the world , especially in Africa .there be many needy people in many country and the answer be to be find , not in create new institution and bureaucracy , but in use most effectively those that we have already .
10514-1984-11-15.6.1.52.3-ulster_unionist_party	there be provision of some £ 50,000 for equipment in the polling station and £ 45,000 for additional staff .that should cover some of the argument of the hon .member for Antrim , North .surely it would not be difficult to change the polling hour .why can we not extend polling hour to 9 or 10 o'clock if it will take long to vote ?I be aware that there have be impersonation .what have be go on in some part of Northern Ireland have be describe to I .some 14 - year - old have masquerade as people much old .however , despite the additional bureaucracy , this be a worthwhile measure and I shall certainly support it .

10206-1984-11-20.8.1.90.7-conservative	the measure be timely and appropriate and will benefit the people of the new town .the Government have always say that they believe — and the Bill be a practical example of that — that bureaucracy may have its place and institution may have a role to play , but that they be never for ever and their role must inevitably change .it be in recognition of that change of role that the Bill be before the House and be warmly welcome by conservative member .
22249-1984-11-20.8.1.97.2-labour	in principle , the extension of democratic control in the new town be unanswerable .there have long be a feeling in Glenrothes — and I imagine elsewhere — that there be a bureaucracy which be unanswerable to the people .I be not in the Chamber when my hon .friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth ( Mr. Hogg ) speak , but I be sure that he have be campaign for long for the meeting of new town corporation to be hold in public .there be a long - stand grievance in that respect which should be remedied , whatever might be the prospect for the corporation .

10291-1984-11-21.5.9.3.1-labour	I congratulate my right hon .friend on his effort , but do he agree that one of the principal reason why the economic strength of the United States of America have outstrip that of Europe be that for the past 200 year the United States have be a common market ?do my right hon .friend accept that the way forward for Europe lie not in increase expenditure and bureaucracy but in remove the internal barrier to a true common market so that , for example , in future , Frenchmen , Germans and Italians will be able to buy british insurance , as we can buy theirs ?
16903-1984-11-21.7.1.60.5-labour	I advise the Government to withdraw the Bill until its implication have be carefully consider in the light of the review that the Government themselves have request .what be the use of call for a review and legislating in advance of it ?it be bureaucracy go mad .it be a good way to keep civil servant in employment .perhaps that be the object of the exercise .
22635-1984-11-26.8.1.49.2-conservative	if I have one criticism of the proposal , it would be direct towards the propose register and registrar .I be not sure why we need to have a new bureaucracy and why it be not possible for the Occupational Pensions Board to undertake certain necessary additional function .I remain to be convince that the register , as distinct from the extension of right to information for member , will bring benefit that be commensurate with either public expenditure cost or the compliance cost that will all on pensions scheme .
19427-1984-11-27.8.2.17.4-conservative	our beautiful countryside be the product not of state planner in the first place but of the million - fold decision of private owner .the state certainly have a vital role as a moderator of change , conciliator and sometimes arbitrator of conflict interest , and sometimes , in critical situation , as the deployer of long - stop power .this be so in the two huge area of the nation 's life which we be now discuss .as much in the art and the manmade heritage as in the natural environment , it be not state committee and bureaucracy that create thing , but recalcitrant artist and individual .the state must tread warily if it be not to extinguish the very pluralism and diversity that a healthy artistic culture need .
19427-1984-11-27.8.2.17.5-conservative	labour be bind to start from the opposite position .even from so moderate a spokesman as the hon .member for Copeland , we can not miss the wishful hankering for even more state planning , state control , ministerie of culture , and all the rest .therefore , the debate be timely if it remind we that a Conservative Government be not , and should not be , simply in the business of an endless competition with the Opposition to see who can create the big and good state bureaucracy .where the state should act , it should do so efficiently .it should deploy the right resource and listen to the good advice .these thing we have do and will continue to do , but all that will be as nothing if the basic framework within which farmer and landowner in the countryside , and artist , architect , patron and owner in our cultural life , go about their business be wrong .

11026-1984-11-30.2.2.62.17-conservative	I know that the Government have take it upon themselves as a major policy task to review unnecessary restriction , red tape and bureaucracy .apart from look at other area such as the shop legislation , our licensing law need to be look at urgently because of the sense of injustice and frustration that be feel not one by customer but by those who need to operate within the law and to apply to the court for extension from time to time .the law be not satisfactory , and I hope that the Government will give some commitment to review it at the early possible opportunity .
19356-1984-11-30.2.3.10.5-conservative	with regard to the 64 scheme in the Department of Trade and Industry which be target on industry we have unwittingly build up our own bureaucracy .although it sound impressive at a general election to say that we have build up 64 scheme , we be in danger of confuse the people whom we seek to help .I agree entirely with my hon .friend about that .we have therefore just complete a repackage exercise .the 64 scheme will be concertina - ed into four coherent package which will cover scheme for regional assistance , export , advisory service and support service .
19356-1984-11-30.2.3.10.6-conservative	for the first time we can set an example to industry in market our own product .in the past we do not set a good example generally .I also appreciate that government be fond of acronym .there be many scheme with acronym , such as CADCAM , CADTES , MAPCON , which mean very little to those whom we hope will be the recipient and beneficiary of they .I also agree that because of the bureaucracy we need to scrap the considerable number of application form that exist .I have introduce a communality of application form , which will be short and write in plain English .

10116-1985-03-21.12.1.3.5-labour	another challenge for the British Government be to speed up the present lumber bureaucracy that make EEC food aid so slow to reach famine victim .it be only after the public start scream that Europe 's bulge grain store split a little of its surplus in the direction of starve Africa .the public again show imagination and compassion when they generously give about £ 40 million to Ethiopia , compare with £ 26 million from the Government .if we be not careful , Ethiopia might be the beginning rather than the end , for it happen in spite of all the warning that be give , not least in this House .
10270-1985-03-22.3.1.5.4-conservative	the other aspect be departmental bureaucracy in Government .someone express to I the fear that in a month air transport would no long be available for transport food .the Minister will be able to tell we whether that be the case .I can see the problem clearly .the Department will be unwilling to carry the financial burden in its vote and will insist that another vote carry it .if we be truly act as a Government , the Department would agree to carry it on its vote because the matter be essential to the policy of the country and for the welfare of a large part of Africa .
10362-1985-03-22.3.1.17.5-conservative	overlap with export subsidy be state development aid , whereby this country , through its government , try to help other government to develop their economy .for many year , I work as a consultant economist , mainly in underdeveloped country and on aid project .I should like to make a few point in the light of my experience .first , I think that there be a more limited scope for this form of Government - to - government aid to assist development than be often suppose .secondly , inevitably this aid involve a great deal of bureaucracy .thirdly , few of the project that be beneficiary of aid could not be do as well , if not well , by private enterprise act in response to the natural incentive of the market place .
10362-1985-03-22.3.1.17.7-conservative	our report be ecstatically receive by the United Nations Economic Commission in Addis Ababa .More and more copy be require , and I recall think wryly that the cost of the paper on which the report be print be considerably great than my salary during the time I have to prepare the report .as so often happen , the report remain unacted upon in the headquarters in Addis Ababa , and , for all I know , it be still there .that have be disappointing , because the government like the idea but could not agree among themselves .the report be bogge down in bureaucracy .
17058-1985-03-22.4.1.1.1-conservative	I beg to move , that this House , recognise the considerable achievement of Government policy in increase the number in work by 340,000 in the year to September 1984 and of the successful launch of the Youth Training Scheme , urge the Government to exploit fully the opportunity to reduce the level of unemployment by develop the Youth Training Scheme into a two year course , lead to level of skill comparable to those obtain from a ' time serve ' apprenticeship , with a heavy emphasis on the new technology , develop the re - training facility offer by the Skillcentre Training Agency to increase the relevance and acceptability of the training offer , reduce the burden of employment bureaucracy on employer , particularly small and medium one , encourage wholeheartedly workshare by abatement of income tax and national insurance contribution , both employer and employee , for part - time half - time employee earn less than half the average wage , prepare the workforce for a short working week and create circumstance favourable to flexible early retirement .I be grateful to my hon .friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford ( Mr. Wells ) for sum up his important debate with such brevity .it give I a few moment to offer some thought to the House on the change structure of employment .it must be rare for a Back - Bench Member to put down for the first time a motion on the Order Paper to be debate later in the week , but appear for the first time on Budget day , and to have the Chancellor of the Exchequer concede almost all of his demand within eight hour .that be my happy position , and I be much encourage by that demonstration by the Chancellor of his willingness to listen to advice from these Benches and to act so speedily .
17058-1985-03-22.4.1.1.2-conservative	cynic might insinuate that I have take many well - thumb suggestion and cobble they together in one of those composite motion so love by the Trade Union Congress at its annual meeting , but they be wrong .while the youth training scheme proposal , the income tax threshold decision and even the alleviation of employment bureaucracy have be well trail , the Chancellor appear to have add his most radical proposal — the eminently sensible reform of national insurance — at the end of his speech and without great prompting from either the press or pressure group .I be entirely persuade that my motion bring about those welcome reform .any suggestion that the right hon .member for Birmingham , Sparkbrook ( Mr. Hattersley ) have anything to do with it , I discount entirely .
17058-1985-03-22.4.1.1.10-conservative	I come now to what I would call the employment bureaucracy that confront employer .there be simply too many official charge with administer a part of the employment function ; and I could name all of those with whom I have have to deal , but that would take too long .one of the major problem of the employment bureaucracy be that employer view the army of official with increase suspicion .there be a feeling that official be interested only in catch out employer to justify their continued existence .there be a real need for a complete change of attitude among the official of the employment bureaucracy .they should seek to understand the problem that confront employer and help employer to overcome those problem .I mention early my enthusiasm for the raising of tax threshold and the reduction in national insurance contribution .as one who still regularly do his company 's payroll , I appreciate the nonsense of a system that allow I to pay someone £ 33·99 for part - time work and charge he no tax or insurance , whereas if I pay he a penny more he would lose £ 3·06 in national insurance contribution , and it would cost I £ 3·55 .I welcome the Chancellor 's determination to resolve that problem .
17058-1985-03-22.4.1.1.13-conservative	I be certain that this year 's Budget be a Budget for job and will make significant inroad into the unemployment figure .that will bring some scorn from those who aspire to miracle , but then miracle have a tendency to turn to ashe quickly .there be no easy panaceas .what be need be a well - train work force spur to great productive effort by a less crush tax regime , work for employer who be less burden by the bureaucracy ; worker who earn a good wage without synthetic overtime hour and who can look forward to sensible and flexible retirement arrangement .
22087-1985-03-25.23.1.130.5-conservative	if we mean - test child benefit so that those who earn more than two third of the national average wage do not receive it , and make corresponding tax cut , everyone would be well off and bureaucracy could be reduce .
16931-1985-04-01.15.1.3.14-conservative	it be , or course , crucial that ATP should be operate as effectively as possible .it be particularly necessary to cut down bureaucracy , because inevitably a number of Departments be involve .we have take some important step towards streamline those procedure .new delegate authority to ODA mean less frequent consultation with the Treasury , although the Treasury have an important role in this matter .it be certainly my aim that no british company should lose a project because Whitehall have be drag its foot .my hon .friend be right to draw attention to the importance of ATP , and I shall ensure that his point be carefully study .
19284-1985-04-02.6.1.1.6-conservative	we have a full discussion of the economic situation , with particular reference to the creation of enterprise and job and the achievement of a single large market by 1992 .in the course of this I propose , first , that the European Council should cut the burden of bureaucracy on business by reduce the number of exist Community rule and regulation , and should scrutinise any propose new Community legislation with regard to its effect on business .secondly , we be all greatly concerned to moderate labour cost and remove restrictive practice , especially with regard to new technology .
18388-1985-04-15.9.1.22.1-conservative	one thing worry I about the minority view in the Warnock report .do the hon .gentleman agree that , if we be to establish surrogacy , even through clinic in the National Health Service without any money be exchange , we would still have the problem to which he refer , such as psychological and social problem ?as a consequence , there would be additional bureaucracy and social worker , and all the other problem — I be not just get at social worker , but I be say that we be build up attendant problem which , frankly , this society can do without .
10038-1985-04-15.10.5.5.5-labour	if the Government will not go along the line of abolition as a matter of principle , I argue strongly that they should look at the problem of the cost involve in the legislation and the creation of a substantial bureaucracy , which will be resent by many school .many school will probably interpret the Bill as an abolition Bill .when one go round school , one find that almost all be under pressure from cut of one sort or another .many local authority seem to feel that rather than cut teaching staff , it be easy to cut back on the hour of the school secretary or people involve in administration .sometimes those cut be ill - advise because it mean that teacher and head end up do more administration and less teaching and do what they be most skilled at .it be a false economy to cut in that area .my impression be that most school be hard press for secretarial assistance .even in a primary school , have to send all the letter —
22584-1985-04-15.10.5.22.3-conservative	the hon .Gentleman also refer to the increase in bureaucracy .I listen with interest to what he say .I can not share his vision of the future — many extra hour of work be impose on school clerical staff — although I accept that there will be some extra work .however , a tremendous amount of extra work will fall on school clerical staff and teaching staff if there be an increase in the number of expulsion and suspension .many govern body discuss expulsion and suspension .report be ask for , and they be often submit to the local education authority .that process involve type checking , reformulation , copying and postage , all of which involve extra expenditure and work .I therefore have double vision when listen to the hon .Gentleman 's speech .
22584-1985-04-15.10.7.12.2-conservative	my hon .friend the Member for Salisbury ( Mr. Key ) be right about the definition of equivalent or alternative .I can imagine much debate continue in education authority , in room in which school government be discuss and maintain , about what be an equivalent .the mind race a little at the prospect of a star system , with two brown star or three red star be award for offence .the child can build up something like a green shield stamp book — a passport to infamy , and possibly expulsion and suspension .I do not believe that that be in the mind of the hon .Member for Denton and Reddish .one can imagine the bureaucracy that would be involve in the creation of a bible of definition for use by those responsible for the control of child in school .
22584-1985-04-15.10.7.12.3-conservative	there should be no difficulty about keep a record of all case of corporal punishment , because such a requirement have be carry out since 1956 .school do that now , and to that extent the new clause be unnecessary .however , the amendment go far than that in an extremely selective way .it extend the record - keeping which school would have to do .although the hon .Gentleman be concern early about the growth of bureaucracy , his new clause seek to increase it .I note that , as the new clause be frame , school not use corporal punishment would be free from the new burden .that seem to make it an extra chore , or an additional penalty to be impose on school that dare to apply corporal punishment .
22584-1985-04-15.10.7.14.1-conservative	the hon .Gentleman give an example of two pupil catch smoke behind the bicycle shed and of one receive punishment , but the other receive a different punishment because he be exempt .we must not forget that the head teacher and staff have some say in the punishment apply other than corporal punishment , and they must apply a judgment as to what appear to be fair to the child .additionally , the difficulty that I outline of collect information at the end of the day , week or month and then record it , be an insuperable point .however , if a school wish to have two book — a corporal punishment book and an equivalent book — there be no reason why it should not do so , if it can afford the time and the bureaucracy to make such a book work .
21906-1985-04-16.10.1.50.3-conservative	in whose interest be it always to have a centralised control system of anything , with a large , expand bureaucracy ?why , the Civil Service .which party be it which have as its principle the decentralisation of control rather than its centralisation , and the reduction of bureaucracy rather than its expansion ?why , the conservative party — this Government 's party .so I come quickly to the first reason why I be unhappy about the Bill .it run counter to what I , as a Conservative , stand for — the minimum of centralisation and the maximum of decentralisation .
11026-1985-04-16.10.1.70.6-conservative	some hon .member have say that they be afraid that by set up the centralised prosecution service we shall create a bureaucracy .however , if it lead to even - handed justice , the measure will be welcome .
10298-1985-04-16.12.1.11.10-liberal_democrats	I hope that the new procedure will not get bogge down in bureaucracy , but , above all , I hope that when people go to a local police station to make a complaint they will be make clearly aware of the procedure and right open to they , as they be in other area , such as civil right and welfare right .I hope that it will be make clear to people that once they decide to invoke the law to help they , certain thing flow from that .for example , a case become sub judice .
10197-1985-04-22.7.2.138.8-labour	the second advantage of the scheme — I be so surprised that the hon .member for Brentwood and Ongar do not make the point that I now wonder whether I fully understand the scheme — be that it set a minimum standard for the private scheme .in other word , an employer can contract out his employee into private arrangement only if he be offer proposal which be well and more generous than the state minimum scheme .therefore , one be lose , without any extra civil servant or any bureaucracy whatever , that regulation of the private scheme which have be so beneficial up to now .it have set a minimum floor , and the private scheme , to attract customer , have have to offer something well .I always think that conservative , as a matter of philosophy , be willing to undertake that sort of competition with the state scheme .now that perhaps competition appear to be tough the only way to compete be to abolish the state scheme .
10574-1985-04-23.7.1.3.6-labour	in those circumstance , the work of the Labour - control Lancashire county council and Labour - control district council have shine like a beacon .they have step in to create jobs—1,200 new job have be create directly by the county council in the front line , not in bureaucracy .Lancashire Enterprises Limited have be establish .it have protect and promote 2,200 job , create 800 training opportunity and make a £ 300,000 profit for the ratepayer .its cost per job create , at £ 4,000 , be less than the Government pay to keep people on the dole .
21776-1985-04-24.7.1.47.6-labour	I understand the argument in favour of just one board , because there would be less bureaucracy .opinion be divide — the insurance industry want two board and the City want one .the City do not want a supervisory body to be set up over which it have no control , and that may be the reason for its reluctance to support the setting up of two board .separate board would mean that City institution would have to obey board rule when they be allow to sell portable pension .I believe that the Secretary of State favour the formation of one board .the Department ask for advice , but the organising committee do not include one assurance company chairman who recommend set up two board
22346-1985-04-24.7.1.79.5-conservative	in practical and political term , one such body be more likely to lead to an SEC .I be sorry that my hon .friend the Member for Chichester ( Mr. Nelson ) , who speak with great experience , do not make it clear whether he be in favour of an SEC or of just one central regulatory body .there be a difference .if anyone want to see what power an SEC operate , he should look at the system in the United States .an enormous corpus of rule , a massive amount of paperwork and a huge bureaucracy be involve .the work for lawyer be phenomenal .as part of that , there be the supervision of the court , which be very expensive and heavyweight .if it can be avoid , and if proper protection can be achieve for the investor , it be in the investor 's interest that that should be do
17442-1985-04-29.22.1.74.18-conservative	as my hon .friend the Member for Horsham wisely say , we must learn from across the Atlantic and note the advantage provide by the exist american tax system , let alone by any future system consequent upon present legislative change .we must attempt to reach a position similar to that outline by President Reagan 's Treasury Department , where there be a high threshold before one enter tax , few tax allowance , few band of tax and a modest top rate .with a structure on those broad outline , one would probably find — as my right hon .friend the Member for Guildford ( Mr. Howell ) also say — that more revenue be raise than with a peaky tax system on a very narrow base with high marginal rate .what be of key importance be the average tax rate and the average tax burden , rather than the marginal rate .as a further advantage , the integration of the Inland Revenue and the DHSS bureaucracy that I have describe would probably result in significant administrative saving .
22612-1985-04-29.22.1.95.10-conservative	the question of who pay VAT and who do not require continue and serious discussion .my hon .friend the Member for Suffolk , South ( Mr. Yeo ) raise that matter .at what level should the threshold be fix , and what be its economic effect at different level ?my hon .friend say that the threshold should be as high as possible , and we would all support that .no one like pay tax .it would minimise bureaucracy and assist small business , especially those start up .however , another point of view be put forward by the Building Employers Confederation , which be that the threshold should be at zero .the idea be that everyone will pay , which will reduce the opportunity for cowboy and will be fair .I suspect that the confederation 's confidence in such a change be misplace because if would certainly increase the black economy , and simply push the threshold effectively to a point at which one either declare for vat or do not delcare .
21651-1985-04-30.7.1.30.3-conservative	as a result of the new procedure , time - consume and routine task which currently fall to the official receiver and his staff will be sweep away .in future they will be able to concentrate on the investigation of the affair of both individual and corporate insolvent .the simplified procedure will also mean that insolvency practitioner who act as liquidator and trustee will be able to carry out their duty without unnecessary bureaucracy and expense .
10036-1985-05-01.8.1.55.5-labour	my right hon .friend the Member for Mansfield ( Mr. Concannon ) also seek to set the matter in context when he say that the many success that there have be in Northern Ireland would not have be possible if there have be a rigorous obstacle course as regard investment .the conclusion of the Public Accounts Committee be , as we have hear , that there ought not to be a hidebound bureaucracy intervene and prevent the kind of investment that be need in Northern Ireland .
22114-1985-05-02.11.9.8.8-labour	the same be true of the National Health Service , although its commissioner be also limit in the sense that he can not investigate matter of clinical judgment .some of we may argue about that , but I realise that this be not the place to do it .nevertheless , in general , the Health Service Commissioner system work , and people understand that it be another attempt to protect the ordinary citizen from big bureaucracy .there be also a Local Government Commissioner .many of we know from experience how local government have grow in size and complexity .it deal with so many matter that impinge on ordinary people 's life that we decide — it be generally accept — that we need an independent complaint procedure so that an individual might have his grievance consider carefully .the Local Government Commissioner system also work extremely well .

10635-1985-05-03.4.3.45.2-plaid_cymru	there have be a great increase in the number of steal vehicle , and safeguard be need , but I question whether they should include cut down the five - day period , which be the only logical way to meet the point make by the hon .member for Torfaen ( Mr. Abse ) .that would impose enormous inconvenience on motorist .they would need to take document with they whenever they be in a car and , when there be more than one driver of a car , multiple copy of the document would have to be make .the bureaucracy about which we hear complaint early would be extend .

22614-1985-05-24.4.1.2.21-conservative	therefore , perhaps with some of the delicious product from the british market , my hon .friend the Minister will sit down with her EC opposite number and iron out those bureaucratic problem .there be a large bureaucracy to be overcome , which confectionery trader concern with claim refund and monetary compensation amount from the intervention board find especially burdensome .the simple requirement be find in non - european sophisticated country such as the United States and Australia .
22614-1985-05-24.4.1.6.3-conservative	a tax be also threaten on oil and fat .no british Minister can give an assurance on this unless the veto be use in the national interest , and then we would be unable to negotiate .two regulation be involve .the first be regulation 262/79 , which make butter available at reduced price from intervention store for use , for example , in pastry product , sugar confectionery and the like .the second be regulation 1932/81 , which make butter available at reduced price from the open market .this be not just a matter of EC bureaucracy .the main benefit to consumer be to pensioner .it be they who most enjoy fudge and other form of oil and fat confectionery and we should be careful not to impose unnecessary tax burden on that section of the population .
19735-1985-06-06.6.3.52.8-conservative	since the recession , more and more small business employer have have to pay themselves less and less in order to satisfy the ever increase and ever more unrealistic requirement of the wage council .the uncertainty of those award — the fact that they can be backdate — be a terrifying prospect for the small employer who have limit capital .these requirement be a very large factor for an employer in decide whether he can afford to take on extra staff .in practice , each new wage council award have mean a cut in the hour that an employee may work .the corollary be an increase in the hour that the employer have to work if he wish to stay in business .when the Opposition hear of business fail , they be the first to say that it be the Prime Minister 's policy that be create unemployment .they never consider that it might be the result of the unfeeling , appalling bureaucracy which be interfere with the day - to - day operation of business which be try to do their good .
19198-1985-06-06.6.3.56.2-conservative	I support wage council .I hope that they will not be abolish and that we shall continue to give they a valuable role to play .however , there be a tremendous need for they to be reform .much of the bureaucracy that go with they be not acceptable to many small business .the value of wage council be not recognise , so they be not use and therefore they can not help the people whom they be there to protect .the most worthwile thing that we do be reform the council , streamline they , make they more efficient and reduce the bureaucracy while keep the basic regulation of protection for the ordinary work people .
19103-1985-06-10.7.1.41.11-conservative	recently I have the privilege of attend the annual general meeting of my local association for the care of those with spina bifida and hydrocephalus .one realise the particular difficulty with which the parent of child who suffer from these complaint must cope .sometimes bureaucracy be unnecessarily harsh in allocate assistance for adaptation .often a grant will be available , and , where that be not the case , some adaptation qualify for relief from vat .that be right and desirable , but it be extraordinary that VAT relief be available for work do to help access to a property and for the provision or alteration of a bathroom , washroom or lavatory , but not if one wish to build or adapt a bedroom for a disabled person .
18853-1985-06-11.7.2.19.7-conservative	all in all , a new strategic approach to development in Africa be emerge .it be an approach which will stress , on the one hand , good research and ecology and effective population policy , and , on the other , not only effective co - ordination and dialogue , but the need for proper incentive to farmer — include adequate food price , realistic exchange rate , a determined drive to escape from deadening and incompetent parastatal and bureaucracy , effective control of public expenditure , and real scope for the private sector .in the development of this strategy , the World Bank have play a lead part — so , on the more short - term side , have the IMF .it be our general policy to work alongside they towards the same objective .
