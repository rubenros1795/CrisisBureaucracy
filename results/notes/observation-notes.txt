# Observation Notes 

- period 1957-1970: "bureaucracy gone mad" popular idiom, relative decline of this idiom after.
- lots of discussion on local government
- "Bennery" as bureaucracy

Parliamentary Arguments
- Labour shares basic problem: it may be that there be some unsuspecting people who think that the Tories be good for """" knock Whitehall in the eye """" and """" down with bureaucracy """" and all that sort of thing , but it would have be well have the Government introduce a hold operation instead of try to legislate for the next Parliament at this late hour of this Parliament
- concious discussion of the term: """before I come here I use to teach politic and administration , and I recall that a number of writer discuss the question of the meaning of the word """" bureaucracy """" .it sometimes have a slightly unpleasant meaning if regard as different from administration pure and simple .in what do this difference lie ?I have be interested in this case , because I find that it offer two definition at this kind of bureaucracy .one be that where a conflict of evidence arise between an official and a citizen on a point in respect of which the citizen can lose or be penalise , whose word be take ?if the word of the official be accept , that be bureaucracy .the citizen 's word should be prefer even when both party be honourable and above reproach in their general conduct .the second definition be where the policy of the Government be to act be one way — in this case to hasten production — and the action of the Department or of the official be the reverse of that ."""
- the hon .member be one of the good example of those who make these usual cheap comment about bureaucracy .
- """in recent year we have hear from our constituent , the newspaper and the television about the grow threat of bureaucracy .as Members of Parliament we have to see middle - grade and senior civil servant and chief officer of town hall .those be the people the press and television refer to as """" the faceless bureaucrat """" .when we in turn visit they we discover that their facility be far superior to our own .it ill behove we to cavil and complain about bureaucrat and civil servant if we do not have the courage to ask for similar facility to do our job .that be the challenge ."""
- which do my right hon .friend think more important to the people of Inverness — a monster plesiosaur in Loch Ness or a monster bureaucracy in Edinburgh
-the Civil Service have achieve the truly remarkable feat of increase the size of the bureaucracy to service the computer , rather than the computer serve to make the bureaucracy more efficient 
- it be quite obvious that the growth of bureaucracy have go on throughout the age .I merely want to point out that I do not like the constant emotive use of the term .

- Jon Rex, Labour Bureaucracy, New Reasoner, 1958, no. 6:  In current left-wing parlance it has become the key excuse-word for explaining how Russia got Stalinized. The bureaucrats there are thought of as a class which develops its own special privileges arising from its peculiar relationship to the means of production, and which devotes most of its energies to defending these privileges rather than to the furtherance of the purposes of socialism. Some anti-Stalinists even go further and suggest that Russian bureaucrats constitute an exploiting class in the same way as capitalists had done previously.
