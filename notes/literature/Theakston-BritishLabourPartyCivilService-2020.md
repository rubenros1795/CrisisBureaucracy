The British Labour Party and the Civil Service in the Twentieth Century

- a vital role for Civil Service in centralist/statist approach
- Labour was assimilated in the "Westminster model" as a movement
- the key message (Balogh): **a good civil service is a precondition for socialism**
- however, incumbent Labour leaders have been institutionally conservative
- intellectually, there has been limited attention for the state
- Fabian Reform traditions
	- Sidney and Beatrice Webb --> "national efficiency" --> line to Laski and Wilsons modernization
	- Fabianism was largely maintained with efficiency, and not democracy
- the 1945 Manifesto mentioned the "better organisation" of government
- in practice, the socialists were intertwined in a bitter battle with the Treasury, the institution that was highly influential in hiring and funding.
- the opposition years in the fifties and sixties were marked by the gradual development of a reform program, culminating most explicitly in the Fabian Tract "The Administrators" (1964) that presented a relatively comprehensive view. 
- Earlier, Labour had aligned with Conservative critiques of "red tape" by means of Richard Crossman's *Socialism and the New Despotism* (1956) that identified the dangers of a centralised state bureaucracy to socialism
- Wilson was one of the "administrators" and felt quite at home in Whitehall
- during his reign, people like Haines and Crossman were very critical
