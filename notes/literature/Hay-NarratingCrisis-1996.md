- The "winter of discontent" as the "discursive key to collective mythology"
- Crisis as a moment of decisive action
- Appeal of New Right: construction of fundamental crisis of state
- Thatcherism as a state-project
- Crisis as process
	- requires subject and object
	- conjuncture must be seen as a moment where decisive intervention can and must be made
	- object: state, subject: state project through which object can remade
- Thatcherism imposed as a new trajectectory upon the institutions of state
- 2 contextual factors:
	- Wilson government, elected to handle the unions and inherited a poisonous cocktail
	- collision course after 1974, abandonment corporatism in 1975, TCU effectively bound
	- initial success of Social Contract
- Choice in '78: wage-restraint or Thatcherism
- "collaboration" narrative TCU leaders
- **discursive selectivity
- elements of discursive construction:
	- subject positions of the reader: "we"
	- othering
	- abstraction from real events
	- notions of direct responsibility
- "process involving the mapping together of a great variety of desparate events unified through the identification of a common essence"
- notions of direct responsibility
- impression: "lurching between series of crises pertaining in a particular situation and that the overall situation is getting worse"
