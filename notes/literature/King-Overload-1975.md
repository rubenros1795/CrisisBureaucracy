- "Why Britain has become so much harder to govern"
- governments survive only one term, problem to be reckoned with
- indicators of overload:
	- failed reform of local government
	- ideals of efficiency and democracy that do not work
	- failures of income policy (unions)
- "a long way from the confident Keynesianismof the 1944 White Paper"
- the fit between manifesto's and realization
- rising waters: "none of us will know when, or whether, the magician will come home"
- two propositions:
	- range of matters for which governments hold themselves responsible has increased. 
		- government as **unlimited insurance company
		- enlargement public sector lays burden on government
		- **when government becomes big, politics becomes big too
	- failing policies
		- talks about "solutions", while everybody fails
		- the posture of modern statesmen is bewilderment
		- bewilderment follows: 1) technology 2) scarcity 3) dependency relationships 4) lack of intelligence (generalists do not comprehend)
- consequences of overload:
	- crisis of the regime, declining trust
	- short-termism
	- change in governmental and public perception of politics
- solutions
	- **decrease reach or increase grasp
	- remove some functions from purview of politically elected
