Improving the performance of the national economy has been a priority item for almost all political movements in Britain. Recipes to achieve this goal are multiple. They contain foci on inflation, full employment and growth: paradigms that have been dominant interchangably throughout the twentieth century.

In the 1960s the "productivity problem" resurfaced. In the immediate postwar years, productivity was deemed important, but restricted to labour productivity, and to be reached via "carrots rather than sticks".

In the 1950s, the productivity problem disappeared, indicated by the weakened position of the British Productivity Council. 

In the 1960s, the PP reappears. Three factors contributed to this:
- the incomes policy debate: the combination of inflation and full employment
- wage bargains --> productivity bargains as a new type of relation
- declinism

Declinism came in two forms:
- Britains imperial overstretch
- polarization between labour and capital at home
