Changes to the machinery of government formed a central part of the Labour agenda in the period between 1964 and 1970. Harold Wilson saw a modern, efficient and capable bureaucracy as essential to realizing planned economic policy and growth. He stepped into a tradition of Fabian elitism that had developed since the late nineteenth century. His "grand designs for Whitehall" included the ill-fated Department for Economic Affairs, that was supposed to draft a National Plan for Economic Growth, but also ministries for Overseas Affairs and technology. With regard to the training of civil servants, Wilson instated the Fulton Committee that reported in 1968.

The effect of Wilson's policies are various. While several institutional novelties did not survive the change in leadership in 1970, the civil service did see a large influx of economics, something that was driven by a C.P. Snow like perception of Whitehall as run by amateurish humanists. 

The 1964 Manifesto laid the ground work for Wilsons plan. It stated explicitly to commit to scientific planning and apply "new thinking". Labour also sought to humanize the administration, leading to a Parliamentary Ombudsman.

The intellectual roots of the endeavour can be located in the tradition of Fabianism, but also in the work of for example Laski, the most important Labour theorist of bureaucracy, and Richard Crossman. A bridge between theory and practice is found in the "Terrible Twins": Thomas Balogh and Nicholas Kaldor, who assisted Wilson in the realization of his plans. Important as well in the bureaucratic thought of Wilson were foreign imaginaries. He was very much fond of French *dirigiste* styles of governing *cabinets*, such as those established by Jacques Delors.

With regard to earlier and later government, Wilson's efforts were not unique per se. There was "nothing particularly socialist" about planning, and ideas about the civil service existed already under MacMillan. 

The Labour experience of '64-'70 was not only positive. Part of the explanations for the anti-bureaucratic turn in the 1970s could therefore be the perceived undermining of reform by civil servants themselves.
