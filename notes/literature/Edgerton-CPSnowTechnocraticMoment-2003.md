## CP Snow and the Technocratic Moment

- The two cultures debate as the opening salvo of a British 'technocratic moment'
- two outcomes of the TCD: science policy machinery was started and the Fulton report on the civi service
- idea of faded technocracy is part of British self-description
- argument: the Technocratic moment was ideologically significant, it fitted in declinism
- anti-history of British technocracy, technocracy itself was denied an existence
- Snow as the spokesman of a new technocratic middle-class
- **anti-historical techno-declinism**
- important role for a mythologized rise of "operational research" in World War 2
- Snow used the Tizard/Lindeman dispute over strategic bombing in later work
- the 1960s new Left reproduced techno-declinist arguments
- neoliberalis identified techno-natinoalism on both sides
