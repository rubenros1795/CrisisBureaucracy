Meredith discusses the concept of the "Labour Right", offering a lot of contextual information. Labour has always had a L-R division, that, however, is problematic as an analytical concept. The history runs deep. Gaitskellites claimed to be a "center" in the 1950s, for example. In general, several axis of division have defined the L-R difference:
- attitutes to the centrality of public ownership and the meaning of liberalism
- intellectuals / trade-unionists
- traditional left-right / centrists

Traditional approaches assume doctrinal blocs

The rhetorical use of "Right" in Labour is very strong. 
Bevins' "Machine-union right" 1930s-1950s
Support of Atlee gov. in 1950s by LAbour Right
Gaitshell, "two schools of moderation"
tradition of "consolidators"

This article has a very good biography on LAbour history
