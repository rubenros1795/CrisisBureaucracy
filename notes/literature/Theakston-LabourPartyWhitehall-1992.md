- Laski and others in the 1930s adopted a Marxist view of the state. However, despite their "excitable talk about 'executive dictatorship', they - in practice - adhered to the idea of a state that could be employed for socialist purpose"
- "the party leadership continued to hold strongly to the Fabian belief in the essential neutrality of the state"
- unwillingness in the 1960s to rethink "basic constitutional questions" --> despite modernization / efficiency. They were merely fashions of managerialism
- in the 1970s there was some kind of throwback on the Labour left to the ideas of the 1930s
- many constitutional issues arose during the 1974-9 Labour government:
	- devlution
	- EEC membership
	- implications of referendum
- The WEbbs' socialism had an unmistakable centralist and bureaucratic flabour
- G.D.H. Cole: guild socialism instead of expertise and bureaucracy
- Four persistent themes stand out when we look at the long-term development of Labour Party attitudes towards the bureaucracy and its reform:
	1. Fabian critique, accepting the pol. neutrality of the civil service, but suggesting that its efficiency needs improving (Webbs, Laski, Cole)
	2. The problem of bureaucratic _power_ and alleged civil service obstruction of socialist measures (sabotage-talk)
	3. The class composition of the higher civil service
	4. Democratic accountability
