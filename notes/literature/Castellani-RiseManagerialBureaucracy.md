- Expenditure Committee Commons:
	- The 1960s saw a rising mood of national decline, in which Britain was perceived as underperforming as a world power. In this atmosphere, the British political system came under pronounced domestic scrutiny. Many established institutions were criticised, among them Parliament. A variety of reform proposals were canvassed, including some to the Commons committee system. Partly in response to such demands, six subject specific select committees were established in the 1966-70 Parliament under Richard Crossman, then Leader of the House. Crossman saw through the establishment of select committees on Agriculture (1966), Science and Technology (1966), Education and Science (1967), Race Relations and Immigration (1968), Overseas Aid and Development (1969), and Scottish Affairs (1969). Not all these committees continued through into the next parliamentary session however. Following this, an Expenditure Committee was set up in 1971, with six sub-committees. Both of these developments were heavily criticised for lacking coherence and structure â€“ this criticism in the following years after implementation provided the impetus for proposals for the development of a new committee system.
