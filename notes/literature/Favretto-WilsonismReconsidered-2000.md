The argument of the article is that Wilsonism was not just a set of rhetorical devices, but a substantive political philosophy, different from both the Old Left (Bevanites) and the Centre Right (Gaitskellites).

It goes against the traditional view of post-1959 revisionism as a comprimise between Croslandite revisionism and Bevanite traditionalism and the idea that Wilsonism represented more a style than a philosophy.

Wilson represented the Centre Left Technocratic Group. 

Wilson wrote in 1957 that public control must be increased to ensure national priorities. 

Interventionism as a European phenomenon in the 1960s. 

Labour revisionism as propagated by Wilson was pragmatist. It advocated planning, but only on technocratic grounds. Planning would increase efficiency and output. The ethical dimension of planning was abandoned. 

Galbraith's "Affluent Society" was a scary foresight for Labour

In the 1960s, the failures of private enterprise dominated Labour publications

The Centre Technocrats believed that socialism had a heightened relevance in times of technological revolution. They also believed this to present the opportunity for a middle way between keynesianism and communism.

The managerial thesis was initially a way for right-wing Labour to oppose nationalization and praise the managers as a cure for bad ownership and economic instability. Gradually, this was replaced by a hostility to manageralism on the Technocratic front (visible in "Signposts for the Sixties").
