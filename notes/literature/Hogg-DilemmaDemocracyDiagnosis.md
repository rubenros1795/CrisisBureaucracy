Two theories of democracy:
	- centralized democracy, "known to me as elective dictatorship"
	- the theory of limited government

"[centralized democracy] will end in a rigid economic plan, and I believe, in a siege economy, a curbed and subservient judiciary, and a regulated press. It will impose uniformity".

"It will depend greatly on caucuses or cadres to exert its will. Some will be directly appointed by patronage as in the increasing number of \`Quangos'. Others will be elected by a tiny minory of dedicated activists and apparatchiks relying on the apathy of the rest as a passport to office.

"Besides these questions, it is necessary to consider the practical utility of different sorts of democratic institutions, and even questions like optimum size and federation. If we ignore questions like these, we shall allow the name of democracy to continue to be used as a cloak for every kind of abomination and folly, blatant tyranny, incompetent bureaucracy, industrial blackmail, social oppression" (p.37)

 "All administration develops into bureaucracy. Human relations are depersonalized and men begin to think of themselves as numbers. But the expense of running an efficient bureaucracy is much higher than that of running a voluntary organization". (p.74)
 
"At the heart of the elective dictatorship resides the govern¬ ment machine, the bureaucracy, the Civil Service. Almost entirely, the functions and working of this intricate mechan¬ ism, perhaps the most perfect, efficient and disinterested the world has ever seen, is the product of convention, tradition, and administrative practice". p.159

"The highly organized and centralized bureaucracy necessary to operate our system of government over a population of more than 60 millions is an evil only because the system of government itself is defective. It was tolerable, even beneficial, in former days precisely because central government controlled so small a portion of our lives. Now that in almost every field of activity, government intrudes, it needs to be broken down into smaller units with divided power. Now that party politics and party loyalties play such a predominant role in legislative policy, the powers of Parliament need to be controlled. The Civil Service is an evil at present, not because of its vices, but because of its virtues, not because it is not impartial, but because it adds to the power of the elective dictators, according impartially its skills, its disciplines, its expertise to the organized minority in power so that it becomes less possible to unseat them". p.165
