The concept of bureaucracy and the arguments involving bureaucracy were closely associated with specific "political paradigms": debates that occupied the center stage at specific times. The early Wilson years, for example, were dominated by visions on modernization and efficiency. In the late 1970s trade union militancy occupied the center stage in the daily newspaper. Bureaucratic arguments are expected to be found in close proximity to these themes, especially because they are so flexible.
