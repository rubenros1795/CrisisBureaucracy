Peter Jenkins, described as the "leading chronicler of the Labour governments of the 1960s and 1970s", showcases the argumentative shifts in the mid-1970s. In his daily columns in 1975 and 1976 the KÃ¶nigswinter journalist fulminously attacked Milton Friedman and the New Right. Yet he adhered to the same problem statements as the Chicago economists: the continuous growth of the state and the incompatibility of this growth with freedom. In another contribution, Jenkins refers to this process as the "revolution of the rising entitlements", drawn from Daniel Bell (1974).
