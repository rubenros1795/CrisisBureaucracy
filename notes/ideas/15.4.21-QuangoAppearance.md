In 1978 the Conservatives conciously introduced the term "quango" into the public debate. The term "quango" ("Quasi Non-Governmental Organisation") was introduced already in 1969 in the work of Alan Pifer and found its way into the academic lexicon. Crucial in the accelerating use of the term was the book _The Quango Explosion_, published in 1978 by the Conservative Political Centre - the educational wing of the party. In the same year, a Shadow Cabinet review of the "quango's" was undertaken by Nigel Lawson, father of Nigella Lawson and to-be Treasury Minister under Thatcher.

Taking a closer look at the first "quango debates" - marked by the same ironic atmosphere as evoked by the term itself: "are little quango's called quangaroos?" - it strikes how Labour MPs immediately took over the term. The Conservative focal points - inefficiency and elite appointments - were eagerly copied by MPs such as Dennis Skinner and Stoddart. Only later did public expenditure get involved.

Ioan Evans noted on the 19th of July of the same year: "we should tackle the problem of the quango's. As a party we must address ourselves to that problem"
