The concern with efficiency, bureaucracy and modern government in the Wilson years were not because Labour had an expansive vision for government. Instead, it stemmed from the technocratic approach to planning. The "ethical dimension" of planning so important for the Old Left was largely abandoned by Wilson. Instead, planning merely served an economic purpose of increasing productivyt and output. This provided a rationale for Labour to engage in bureaucracy arguments.

(Favretto, 2000)
