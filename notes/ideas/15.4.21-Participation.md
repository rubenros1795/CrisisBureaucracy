The Labour thinking about civil service and bureaucracy has been marked by several key concepts. In the early Wilson years it was "efficiency" and "modernization". The New Left movement in the late 1960s however, provoked the increased centrality of another concept: 'participation'. Geoffrey Searle, writing in his 1971 book on the Fabianist notion of "National Efficiency" wrote:
	
	Most modern periods in British history have been dominated by a political catchcry: some phrase or slogan which sums up the hopes and fears of the hour, though in a maddeningly imprecise way. Thus, in the early 1960s politicians of all parties, newspaper columnists and other public figures were vying with one another to proclaim their commitment to 'Modernization'. More recently, the virtues of 'Participation' have been dinned into our ears.
