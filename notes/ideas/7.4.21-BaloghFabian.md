During the opposition years until 1964 Labour opinion about the Civil Service had been shaped by Thomas Balogh's "blistering attacks on the Treasury" and on the amateurism that marked the Oxbridge generalists (see: Balogh, 1959 in Thomas *The Establishment*). In 1964 an influential Fabian Tract appeared that formulated an expansive critique on amateurism and inefficiency, setting the tone for the Wilson ambitions to come.
