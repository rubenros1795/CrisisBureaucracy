Besides the polemic debates on Brussels and Home Rule, the socialist arguments for and against bureaucracy saw change under the pressures of the New Left. Calls for "participation" marked Labour political thought in the early seventies. In a Fabian Tract published in 1973, participation is seen as both an end in itself (a "means to self-realisation") as a way to achieve better decisions and to combat the power of centralised bureaucracy. 

What is interesting in the calls for participation is the changing view on bureaucracy that shimmers behind the participative enthousiasm. The development of participation is, according to the Tract, not only a "necessary response to the growth in scale services", but also an implicit denunciation of centralised planning. "Planning", according to the Tract, "is a handicap for the bureaucrat". Moreover, calls for participation were combined with diagnosis of inefficiency that were common in the late 1960s, but those were now enriched by explicit focus on cost.

In the opening chapter, sociologist Peter Marris describes the dilemma of the expanding government and the inability to curtail costs: the overload thesis in a different form.
