The early 1970s also saw the appearance of theoretic perspectives upon bureaucracy that slowly found their way into public debate. Most well-known is William A. Niskanen's _Bureaucracy and Representative Government_ (1971), the widely influential work that laid the foundations for the New Right theory of an ever-expanding bureaucracy: the academic face of the "rising waters". Niskanen drew on earlier works by Von Mises (_Bureaucracy_, 1944) and Anthony Down (_Inside Bureaucracy_, 1967) (Hindwood, 2006; 130-140).
