In years of the Heath government various frequencies and collocation scores go down. It appears that "bureaucracy" experienced a period of relative decline as a topical concept. Explanations for this are multiple. The change of the incumbent Conservatives, usually the most eager to use arguments pertaining to bureaucracy, to use the concept declined naturally. In Labour circles, bureaucracy was increasingly associated with democratic accountability due to the New Left revolt in the party's intellectual landscape. Labour MPs argued that "There is a great danger that Britain will be subject to decisions of a bureaucracy without adequate parliamentary scrutiny or check." (Thomas Peart, 1972)

Besides these intellectual dynamics, there are also two political issues that proved cause for 'distraction': the EEC accession debate in 1972-74, the continuous debates about devolution and the Local Government Act in 1972.
