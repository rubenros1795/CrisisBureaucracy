British socialist thought knows an anti-statist "tradition" - or at least a strand of thinking - since the early postwar years. It was then that authors such as G.D.H. Cole, Harold J. Laski and R. H. Tawney "took an early anti-statist stance" (Callaghan, 1989). Later, in the late 1970s, various Labour thinkers blamed socialist politics for its blind trust in planning and expertise. This relates closely to what David Edgerton calls "anti-historical techno-declinism": the idea that Britain was in decline and taken over incapable civil servants. 

An ahistorical object was constructed (the ever-expanding state bureaucracy) and a discourse of realism imposed itself upon Labour thinkers.
