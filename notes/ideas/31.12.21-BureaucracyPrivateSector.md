Labour arguments against bureaucracy were not always targeted at governmental bureaucracy. Private enterprise also produced needless bureaucratic bumbledom, according to many Labour MPs. A broader intellectual context in which these arguments were located is the waning support for the "managerial thesis" in socialist circles. Initially, Burnham's ideas were taken up by Labour rightwingers to argue against nationalization. Managers could solve the problem of bad ownership and inefficiency, they argument. When control was separated from ownership, all kinds of problems for the socialists would disappear. In the 1960s, this managerial thesis was rejected. Labour thinkers would argue the opposite: managers would increase bureaucracy and stand in the way of efficiency: the holy grail for the Centre Left Technocrats that came to power in the form of Wilson.
