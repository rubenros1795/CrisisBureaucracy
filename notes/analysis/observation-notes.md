# Observation Notes 

- period 1957-1970: "bureaucracy gone mad" popular idiom, relative decline of this idiom after.
- lots of discussion on local government
- "Bennery" as bureaucracy

## Parliamentary Arguments (from annotated set)
- Labour shares basic problem: it may be that there be some unsuspecting people who think that the Tories be good for knock Whitehall in the eye and down with bureaucracy and all that sort of thing , but it would have be well have the Government introduce a hold operation instead of try to legislate for the next Parliament at this late hour of this Parliament
- concious discussion of the term: before I come here I use to teach politic and administration , and I recall that a number of writer discuss the question of the meaning of the word bureaucracy .it sometimes have a slightly unpleasant meaning if regard as different from administration pure and simple .in what do this difference lie ?I have be interested in this case , because I find that it offer two definition at this kind of bureaucracy .one be that where a conflict of evidence arise between an official and a citizen on a point in respect of which the citizen can lose or be penalise , whose word be take ?if the word of the official be accept , that be bureaucracy .the citizen 's word should be prefer even when both party be honourable and above reproach in their general conduct .the second definition be where the policy of the Government be to act be one way — in this case to hasten production — and the action of the Department or of the official be the reverse of that ."""
- the hon .member be one of the good example of those who make these usual cheap comment about bureaucracy .
- """in recent year we have hear from our constituent , the newspaper and the television about the grow threat of bureaucracy .as Members of Parliament we have to see middle - grade and senior civil servant and chief officer of town hall .those be the people the press and television refer to as the faceless bureaucrat .when we in turn visit they we discover that their facility be far superior to our own .it ill behove we to cavil and complain about bureaucrat and civil servant if we do not have the courage to ask for similar facility to do our job .that be the challenge ."""
- which do my right hon .friend think more important to the people of Inverness — a monster plesiosaur in Loch Ness or a monster bureaucracy in Edinburgh
-the Civil Service have achieve the truly remarkable feat of increase the size of the bureaucracy to service the computer , rather than the computer serve to make the bureaucracy more efficient 
- it be quite obvious that the growth of bureaucracy have go on throughout the age .I merely want to point out that I do not like the constant emotive use of the term .

- Jon Rex, Labour Bureaucracy, New Reasoner, 1958, no. 6:  In current left-wing parlance it has become the key excuse-word for explaining how Russia got Stalinized. The bureaucrats there are thought of as a class which develops its own special privileges arising from its peculiar relationship to the means of production, and which devotes most of its energies to defending these privileges rather than to the furtherance of the purposes of socialism. Some anti-Stalinists even go further and suggest that Russian bureaucrats constitute an exploiting class in the same way as capitalists had done previously.

## Specific Speakers

**Gerald Kaufman (runner up most frequent user in 1972)

Kaufman denounced socialism, if it meant to be synonymous with bureaucracy. Arguing that:

	I believe that citizens, of whatever age, whatever their callings, whatever they wish to do, in their working hours or in their spare time, should be allowed to do it, provided they are not breaking the law and not causing harm and nuisance to others, regardless of the fact that others may dislike what they are doing, which is another thing. I am sick and tired of attempts of Governments and of back benchers on both sides of the House to gird citizens about with committees and rules and regulations and codes of practice and the rest.

**Brynmor John (runner up 1973)**

Brynmor John, Labour MP for Pontypridd, argued in 1973 that:

	We have seen that in field after field their instinct has been to transfer powers from Parliament to a bureaucracy. This is a further example of that propensity. But no matter; we shall take away this sort of arrangement from the bureaucratic organisation and place it in the hands of democratic bodies
	
**Roy Hughes (runner up 1975**

Roy Hughes, a union organizer and Labour MP, explicitly combined different critiques on bureaucracy.

	Whilst I support the hon. and learned Gentleman's protest against the increase of bureaucracy in local government as a result of local government reorganisation, so hurriedly pushed through the House by the last Conservative Government, I find it difficult to reconcile it with his own party's support of British membership of the Common Market, which will further increase that bureaucracy. How can the hon. and learned Gentleman reconcile that contradiction in his argument?

**John Stonehouse (top most frequent user in 1976)**

John Stonehouse, cabinet member under Wilson and the Labour MP who most frequently spoke of "bureaucracy" in 1976 is a good example of the declinist discourse of the "rising waters" as adopted by Labour MPs. On the 24th of February 1976, for example, Stonehouse invokes the statistic that under Wilson, the growth in non-industrial Civil Service has constituted 30 percent. Two months later, he even refers to the sensitivity of Ministers to attacks on bureaucracy when he pleas for realism: 

	"Members attack the inefficiencies and waste of the Civil Service as though these people must somehow be immune from the rules of efficiency which should govern other activities in our society. In fact, the growth of the crushing bureaucracy is central to our problem, and we shall not solve our manufacturing weaknesses until the size and the burden of the bureaucracy is reduced."
	
Involving his previous experience in the first Wilson government, Stonehouse later continued: 

	The growth of the bureaucracy is, of course, not confined to the public sector. It exists in private industry also. But it tends to be worse in public enterprise, because in that sector the unions are better able to protect their positions and stop the adoption of efficient techniques. I saw that for myself when I was Postmaster-General.
	
and:

	it is extremely difficult to get any positive action on this key question of public sector bureaucracy and inefficiency. It has become a sacred cow in our society. Once the bureaucracy gets a hold, it is like a pernicious cancer and it is difficult to dislodge.

Stonehouse even went as far as arguing for cutbacks:

	Secondly, I would reduce the crippling burden of bureaucracy in England. We should put the Civil Service on a rigorous cost-effective basis and, as a start, cut it back overnight by 30 per cent, to the levels of 1964.
	
**Leo Abse (runner-up most frequent user in 1976)

Another example is Leo Abse, a Labour backbencher known for his independent thinking. Similarly to Stonehouse and others he pointed to the growth in bureaucracy in his own constituency (1976-01-15).

**Roy Hughes (1976)**

The observation that bureaucracy was expanding and the water is rising is also found in some remarks by Roy Hughes:

	In local government bureaucracy has just about reached saturation point. I am not blaming our local representatives for that because the structure was laid down by the last Tory Government. Reorganisation was highly inflationary and has had an evil effect on the British economy.


**Eric Heffer (1977)**

Heffer demonstrates how the rising waters frame had become shared across political lines:

	It is quite obvious that the growth of bureaucracy has gone on throughout the ages. I merely wanted to point out that I did not like the constant emotive use of the term.
	
	
**Denzel Davies (1977)**

	The hon. Gentleman has raised a case that illustrates the difficulty in any modern complex society of any democratic body exercising detailed control over a bureaucracy. Bureaucracy is not necessarily a bad thing, but there is difficulty in controlling detailed Government expenditure. However, I must repeat that at the end of the day Parliament has the authority and the power to control Government expenditure. It can deny the Government money, and if that happens to any Government they must hand over to somebody else.

**General**
In the Opposition years for Labour (1970-4) it appears that great emphasis was laid on the democratic accountability of bureaucracy. Reinforced by the EEC membership debate and the continuous debates on devolution, Labour MPs argued that "There is a great danger that Britain will be subject to decisions of a bureaucracy without adequate parliamentary scrutiny or check." (Thomas Peart, 1972)

The early 1970s also saw the appearance of theoretic perspectives upon bureaucracy that slowly found their way into public debate. Most well-known is William A. Niskanen's _Bureaucracy and Representative Government_ (1971), the widely influential work that laid the foundations for the New Right theory of an ever-expanding bureaucracy: the academic face of the "rising waters". Niskanen drew on earlier works by Von Mises (_Bureaucracy_, 1944) and Anthony Down (_Inside Bureaucracy_, 1967) (Hindwood, 2006; 130-140).

Quango:
- rapid rise in 1978, immediate use by Labour
- term coined in 1969 (Cole, 2005; 322)
- connected to Butskellite consensus
- pushed by Philip Holland: _The Quango Explosion_
- In 1978 a shadow cabinet review of quangos was associated with a general review of public expenditure undertaken by Nigel Lawson6
- waste and inefficiency as focal points, enabling alignment with previous Labour ideas

The convergence in the arguments on bureaucracy and the narrative of the rising waters is showcased by the introduction of a new term in political discourse in the late 1970s.
