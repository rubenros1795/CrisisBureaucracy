  abstract = {Democratic Governance examines the changing nature of the modern state and reveals the dangers these changes pose to democracy. Mark Bevir shows how new ideas about governance have gradually displaced old-style notions of government in Britain and around the world. Policymakers cling to outdated concepts of representative government while at the same time placing ever more faith in expertise, markets, and networks. Democracy exhibits blurred lines of accountability and declining legitimacy. Bevir explores how new theories of governance undermined traditional government in the twentieth century. Politicians responded by erecting great bureaucracies, increasingly relying on policy expertise and abstract notions of citizenship and, more recently, on networks of quasi-governmental and private organizations to deliver services using market-oriented techniques. Today, the state is an unwieldy edifice of nineteenth-century government buttressed by a sprawling substructure devoted to the very different idea of governance--and democracy has suffered. In Democratic Governance, Bevir takes a comprehensive look at governance and the history and thinking behind it. He provides in-depth case studies of constitutional reform, judicial reform, joined-up government, and police reform. He argues that the best hope for democratic renewal lies in more interpretive styles of expertise, dialogic forms of policymaking, and more diverse avenues for public participation.},

The reforms attempted can be placed within a long British socialist tradition, flavoured by Fabian elitism and containing intellectual contradictions. The ideological basis for the objectives being pursued, such as economic expansion, was never properly explored or developed. Harold Wilson's Civil Service `revolution' was not entirely original, nor complete, nor fully successful. But some of his innovations, such as the incorporation of more outsiders into Whitehall, the first use of special advisers, and the establishment of the Ministry of Overseas Development and the Welsh Office, did last. Certain features of Tony Blair's approach to Whitehall, such as the deployment of special advisers and attempts to co-ordinate government and communications more fully from the centre, are reminiscent of the Wilson period. The resilience of the Treasury was apparent through both premierships. An unusual continuity can be traced between attempts to plan growth under Wilson and targets for improvements and reform in public services under Blair.},

  abstract = {Selected as a Financial Times Best Book of 2013Governments today in both Europe and the United States have succeeded in casting government spending as reckless wastefulness that has made the economy worse. In contrast, they have advanced a policy of draconian budget cuts\textemdash austerity\textemdash to solve the financial crisis. We are told that we have all lived beyond our means and now need to tighten our belts. This view conveniently forgets where all that debt came from. Not from an orgy of government spending, but as the direct result of bailing out, recapitalizing, and adding liquidity to the broken banking system. Through these actions private debt was rechristened as government debt while those responsible for generating it walked away scot free, placing the blame on the state, and the burden on the taxpayer. That burden now takes the form of a global turn to austerity, the policy of reducing domestic wages and prices to restore competitiveness and balance the budget. The problem, according to political economist Mark Blyth, is that austerity is a very dangerous idea. First of all, it doesn't work. As the past four years and countless historical examples from the last 100 years show, while it makes sense for any one state to try and cut its way to growth, it simply cannot work when all states try it simultaneously: all we do is shrink the economy. In the worst case, austerity policies worsened the Great Depression and created the conditions for seizures of power by the forces responsible for the Second World War: the Nazis and the Japanese military establishment. As Blyth amply demonstrates, the arguments for austerity are tenuous and the evidence thin. Rather than expanding growth and opportunity, the repeated revival of this dead economic idea has almost always led to low growth along with increases in wealth and income inequality. Austerity demolishes the conventional wisdom, marshaling an army of facts to demand that we austerity for what it is, and what it costs us.},

Blyth analyzes the 1930s and 1970s, two periods of deep-seated institutional change that characterized the twentieth century. Viewing both periods of change as part of the same dynamic, Blyth argues that the 1930s labor reacted against the exigencies of the market and demanded state action to mitigate the market's effects by "embedding liberalism" and the 1970s, those who benefited least from such "embedding" institutions, namely business, reacted against these constraints and sought to overturn that institutional order. In Great Transformations, Blyth demonstrates the critical role economic ideas played in making institutional change possible and he rethinks the relationship between uncertainty, ideas, and interests on how, and under what conditions, institutional change takes place. Mark Blyth is an assistant professor of political science at the Johns Hopkins University specializing in comparative political economy. He has taught at Columbia University, and at the University of Birmingham, UK. Blyth is a member of the editorial board of the Review of International Political Economy.},

This creates a paradox as both logics cannot be simultaneously true. However, it is a generative paradox insofar as the power of the policy paradigms framework emerges, in part, from this attempt to straddle these distinct positions, producing an argument that is greater than the sum of its parts. In the second part of the article, I discuss the recent global financial crisis, an area where we should see third-order change, but we do no not.

The Next Steps agencies reform, begun by the Thatcher Government and continued during the Major administration, had the potential for making accountability stronger in the areas in which they operated, and performance management produced a permanent evolution towards a government by measurement. The legal framework of the Civil Service was revised to include the Civil Service Management Code, as well as the Code of Conduct for Special Advisers. A process of codification was undertaken in order to protect administrative traditions and constitutional conventions. Problem related to ministerial responsibility raised for the changing of bureaucratic organization.

This is particularly the case within the Westminster tradition where such turnover is limited in nature, with most appointees coming from within the ranks of the public service. This article challenges the assertion that turnover in the Westminster tradition is homogeneously internal. Theorizing that new governments appoint senior public servants to increase their control over the bureaucracy, and that the desire for control is negatively correlated to trust, this article develops hypotheses between the trust new governments harbour towards the bureaucracy and whether they appoint and dismiss bureaucrats from within or outside the public service. The hypotheses are tested with longitudinal data measuring internal and external appointments and departures to the senior public service in Canada's provincial governments over a period of 18\,years. The results from various multinomial regression models suggest that political appointments to the public service are not as homogenous as frequently suggested. Although a transition in the governing party and a newly elected premier from the same party of the previous government both lead to an increase in bureaucratic turnover, a newly elected first minister has a greater incidence of internal turnover than a change in party, meanwhile the level of external turnover does not meaningfully differ between these two political events.},

  abstract = {In the context of growing concern during the 1960s about Britain's relative economic decline, and parallel concern about the increasing remoteness of government and administration from the people, there was growing interest among commentators in modernising Britain's political institutions, in order to render them more effective and representative. Much of this interest was shared by Labour's Richard Crossman, who had himself previously written scholarly analyses of the deficiencies of Parliament, and had proposed reforms to reverse its apparent decline and marginalisation. Crossman was granted a unique opportunity to give practical effect to his proposals when he was appointed Leader of the House in 1966, but he enjoyed only limited success, due largely to the fact that few of his senior Labour colleagues shared his enthusiasm for reform, particularly once they had risen to Ministerial rank, and thus enjoyed the power and privileges this bestowed upon them. Many Ministers also failed to discern a link between parliamentary reform and reversal of Britain's economic decline. On the contrary, the economic problems confronting the 1964\textendash 1970 Labour Governments were widely viewed as necessitating stronger action from the centre, and this would hardly be achieved by devolving power to, or sharing it with, backbench MPs in the House of Commons.},

Many of the chapters in this book examine whether devolution is enhancing democratic accountability, or creating a fragmentary state with conflict and tensions between the Westminster government and the devolved bodies.   The focus is on the financial mechanisms for democratic accountability both in the UK and in international comparator countries (New Zealand, Norway, and the US). This book examines the turbulent pattern of relationships between central and devolved government and explores whether the present arrangements for devolution in the UK represent an end game, or whether they may be merely a stepping stone to a more fully fledged federal state. It is argued that the main thrust of many of the financial reforms in the UK has confounded, obfuscated, and complicated the desire for democratic accountability.},

  abstract = {From its very foundation, most observers considered the ideas that motivated the British Labour Party to have been essentially empirical. As early as 1929 the German social democrat Egon Wertheimer famously remarked that, unlike his own party, Labour was ``completely unencumbered by philosophy, theory and general views of life.'' Over sixty years later, this opinion was endorsed by an academic survey of European social democracy that concluded that the party possessed a uniquely ``practical brand of ideology.'' Labour's apparent peculiarity is conventionally explained with reference to its historic role as the political arm of the British trade union movement and the privileged place held by members of the organized working class within party institutions. This intimate association supposedly gave rise to ``Labourism,'' characterized by many as a myopic preoccupation with the defense of male industrial workers' material interests. Labour's strong union link is also thought to have promoted a dominant ``ethos'' that directly reflected the proletarian experience of exploitation. Only in the 1970s, after many working-class members had left and been replaced by more bourgeois and marxist-inclined recruits, did scholars suppose that Labour became, albeit temporarily, more overtly doctrinaire.In challenging this entrenched view of Labour thought, the present article focuses on the period between 1950 and 1970, which began with the lifting of the last vestiges of wartime austerity and ended just before the onset of a world recession. These years have now assumed the glow of, as Eric Hobsbawm has put it, ``a sort of Golden Age.''},

It acts as a discursive key to a collective mythology seemingly appealed to, and conjured, in each wave of industrial unrest, in each hint of political turmoil and, until recently, whenever the election of a Labour Government looked credible. In this paper I consider the rhetorical strategies and linguistic devices deployed by the tabloid media in the narration of the events of the winter of 1978-79. I argue for an interpretation of the winter of discontent as a moment of state crisis. By crisis however I do not refer to the mere accumulation of contradictions but rather to a moment of transition, a moment of decisive intervention. Within such a framework, the winter of discontent emerges as a strategic moment in the transformation of the British state, and perhaps the key moment in the pre-history of Thatcherism. For, as I hope to demonstrate, the initial appeal of the New Right was premised upon its ability to offer a convincing construction of the winter of discontent as symptomatic of a more fundamental crisis of the state. In such a moment of crisis, a particular type of decisive intervention was called for. In this discursive construction of crisis the New Right proved itself capable of changing, if not the hearts and minds of the electorate, then certainly the predominant perceptions of the political context. It recruited subjects to its vision of the necessary response to the crisis of a monolithic state besieged by the trade unions. This was perhaps the only truly hegemonic moment of Thatcherism. It occurred well before Mrs Thatcher entered Number 10. It is thus not surprising that one of the most enduring and distinctive legacies of Thatcherism has been the new political lexicon of crisis, siege and subterfuge born of the winter of discontent.},

As such, it serves as a potentially instructive focus for debate both about the conditions under which economic paradigms are replaced and consolidated and the evolution of such paradigms through the process of institutionalization. In this paper I suggest that the institutionalization of this new economic paradigm has been associated with the shift from a normative to a normalized and necessitarian neoliberalism. I examine the role played by rationalist assumptions in this extended process of normalization-institutionalization. After presenting a stylized account of the evolution of British neoliberalism, I show how New Labour's monetary policy regime is the heir to the legacy of monetarism and its agenda of labour-market reform is the heir to Thatcherism's supply-side economics. I suggest that the time-inconsistency thesis and the business school globalization thesis have played an equivalent role, for New Labour, to that played for the new right by monetarism and supply-side economics in legitimating neoliberalism. In this way neoliberalism has been normalized. In the final sections of the paper I reflect on the implications of the normalized and necessitarian character of neoliberalism in Britain for its contestability and for democratic economic governance more broadly.},

Abstract The article divides the history of Thatcherism into seven main stages from its pre-history before 1979 through to the revival of the neoliberal project by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition of 2010\textendash 2015. This periodization is based on the changing strategic line of Thatcherism and is related not only to Mrs Thatcher's practice of conviction politics as a political leader but also to the defining features of neoliberalism considered as an economic and political project. The analysis then reviews the features of the neoliberal regime shift instituted under Mrs Thatcher once it had been consolidated, including the strengthening of the City of London and a finance-dominated accumulation trajectory at the expense of uneven development elsewhere in the United Kingdom and, eventually, the financial crisis that undermined the New Labour Govern-ment in 2007\textendash 10. This crisis was the pretext for the previously noted revival of the Thatcherite project. The article then considers the dialectic of authoritarian populism and statism and ends with brief remarks on how the recent and continuing fisco-financial crisis has provided an opportunity for the revival of a `two nations ' neoliberal austerity politics.},

  abstract = {Between 1945 and 2005, the United Kingdom underwent two deep-seated institutional transformations\textemdash roughly starting around 1945 and 1979 respectively\textemdash when all received wisdom on how to govern the economy was called into question and the basic terms of the political debate were changed. Attlee and Thatcher emerge as the great "innovators" who were able to effectively implement most of their political platforms. During those two time intervals (1945-1979 and 1979-2005), there were also two opportunities to challenge the prevailing institutional arrangements. Heath won the general election in 1970 promising a radical overhaul of Britain's institutions, only to fail in 1972, when he was forced to take a U-turn; and Blair's "New Labour," winning a larger majority in 1997 than Labour in 1945, did not accomplish a major break with the Thatcherite settlement but ended up strengthening it instead. The dissertation attempts to answer this puzzle by considering the impact of economic crisis on bringing about policy change, through an intertemporal and qualitative comparison of four case studies: 1945-51 (Attlee), 1970-74 (Heath), 1979-90 (Thatcher), and 1997-05 (Blair). The central argument of the dissertation is that the key to continuity and change in economic policymaking is the role that available ideas play during periods of sharp economic downturns in defining the various options of government policy. When economic turmoil is perceived both by the general electorate and constructed by the political establishment as a real "crisis," then new ideas will matter if they offer an explanation of what went wrong, and how it call be fixed, and subsequently can function as a roadmap for an emerging new institutional structure. If there is, however, no real perception of crisis, then there will be little incentive for radical transformations, and institutional change will at most be incremental. In the latter case, new ideas will play a marginal role and will only be implemented insofar as they 'fit' into the existing settlement, leading to a path dependent future institutional development. Instead of changing the status quo, these changes will end up strengthening the current institutions by eliminating their minor weaknesses, making future reform more difficult.},

This review provides a close study of Brittan's 'The economic contradictions of democracy' (1975, hereafter ECD)-one of the most cited contr\`ibutions to the declinist literature of the decade-in which Brittan warned that, without remedial action, liberal democracy 'is likely to pass away within the lifetime of people now adult'. In this reappraisal of Brittan's ECD, it is argued that this paper is much more than just eloquent, scholarly declinism, and in the process, the generic problem facing all contemporary historians of thought and policy is confronted: what is the influence of any one individual and/or work? The reappraisal relates directly to central themes of the 1970s 'crisis', especially 'overhad' and 'ungovernability'; it examines the competitive nature of the market for declinist prognostications (notably the Jay\textemdash Brittan nexus), with one objective being to provide a counterbalance to much recent scholarship which has over-focused on think-tanks at the expense of elite journalists who were very far from being academics manques; and, finally, it reviews Brittan's role in the so-called Thatcher revolution, where much has been claimed but little documented.},

Wright Mills examines and critiques the organization of power in the United States, calling attention to three firmly interlocked prongs of power: the military, corporate, andpolitical elite. The Power Elite can be read as a good account of what was taking place in America at the time it was written, but its underlying question of whether America is as democratic in practice as it is in theory continues to matter very much today. What The Power Elite informed readers of in 1956 was how much the organization of power in America had changed during their lifetimes, and Alan Wolfe's astute afterword to this new edition brings us up to date, illustrating how much more has changed since then. Wolfe sorts out what is helpful inMills' book and which of his predictions have not come to bear, laying out the radical changes in American capitalism, from intense global competition and the collapse of communism to rapid technological transformations and ever changing consumer tastes. The Power Elite has stimulated generations ofreaders to think about the kind of society they have and the kind of society they might want, and deserves to be read by every new generation.},

Economic growth did bound ahead, far outstripping pre-war performance and reaching a climacteric of over 3 per cent a year in the late 1960s and early 1970s.2 Total economic output rose by 83 per cent between 1951 and 1973, while real personal disposal incomes rose by 77 per cent and consumer expenditure by 79 per cent.3 Consumer goods of all types filled British homes. The figure for households containing televisions leapt from 35 per cent to 96 per cent between 1955 and 1975, and the figure for telephones rose from 19 to 52 per cent.4 Governments constantly entreated British workers to greater efforts, but as the economist Clare Griffin noted as early as 1950, `the worker is told Britain is poor \ldots{} but the worker doesn't feel poor. He has more money than before and his job is more secure'.5 This book intends to examine this central paradox in British economic, social and political life.},

Some analysts see it as in decline, possibly terminally, overwhelmed by the challenges posed by the reforms and the changes in its policy environment; others see it as in the vanguard by adopting modernising reforms and adapting to new public service values. After critically examining these opposing perspectives on civil service `decline' and `modernisation', we conclude that these contrasting analyses suffer from adopting too limited a view of the British civil service in its historical and international context. The British civil service has during its long history progressively modernised and in a progressive way\textemdash becoming less corrupt, more accountable, more pluralist, more responsive to citizens' needs\textemdash often sceptical about reform, but nevertheless moving with the times.},

  abstract = {"Why did such highly abstract ideas as truth, knowledge, or justice become so important to us? What was the point of coming to think in these terms? In The Practical Origins of Ideas, Matthieu Queloz presents a philosophical method designed to answer such questions: the method of pragmatic genealogy. Pragmatic genealogies are partly fictional, partly historical narratives exploring what might have driven us to develop certain ideas in order to discover what these do for us. The book uncovers an under-appreciated tradition of pragmatic genealogy which cuts across the analytic--continental divide, running from the state-of-nature stories of David Hume and the early genealogies of Friedrich Nietzsche to recent work in analytic philosophy by Edward Craig, Bernard Williams, and Miranda Fricker. However, these genealogies combine fictionalizing and historicizing in ways that even philosophers sympathetic to the use of state-of-nature fictions or real history have found puzzling. To make sense of why both fictionalizing and historicizing are called for, the book offers a systematic account of pragmatic genealogies as dynamic models serving to reverse-engineer the points of ideas in relation not only to near-universal human needs, but also to socio-historically situated needs. This allows the method to offer us explanation without reduction and to help us understand what led our ideas to shed the traces of their practical origins. Far from being normatively inert, moreover, pragmatic genealogy can affect the space of reasons, guiding attempts to improve our conceptual repertoire by helping us determine whether and when our ideas are worth having"--},

To describe this situation some coined the term ``consultocracy,'' assuming that the emergence of the NPM created a growing demand for business management expertise in government circles that allowed consultants to penetrate the state and become powerful policy actors. Rather than taking these matters as given, I ask how has it been possible for consultants to become (or not) influential players in the process of administrative reform. It is argued that Britain, and to a lesser extent Canada, have been more likely than France to give rise to a ``consultocracy'' when implementing NPM reforms in the 1980s because in these two countries, management consultancy emerged earlier and is more strongly developed than in France because of its historical link with accountancy. Whereas French consultants only began to enter public administration in the 1980s, British and Canadian consultants have been involved in the last 30 years in the construction of the state's management capacities. Through their participation in these institution-building processes, they established networks of expertise with the state and acquired the experience of work in government. Over the years, this created opportunities for consultants to make their voices heard in the inner circles of decision-making and made possible the exercise of influence that they are now said to have on policy.},

Reagan declared that he had come to Washington to ``drain the swamp'' of bureaucracy, and set up the Grace Commission to investigate the operation of the U.S. government. Thatcher and Mulroney were equally committed to reform and initiated wide-ranging changes. By the end of the 1990s, the changes were dramatic. Many governments operations had been privatized in all three countries, and new management techniques had been introduced. In Great Britain, one observer judged that the changes were historically as important as the collapse of Keynesian economics.  Is government now better in these countries, and was political leadership right in focusing on management of the bureaucracy as the villain? Savoie suggests that the reforms overlooked problems now urgently requiring attention and, at the same time, attempted to address non-existent problems. He combines theory and research based on sixty-two interviews, nearly all with members of the executive branch of the governments of Britain, Canada and the United States.},

In this latter period the creation of collaborative institutions has become a core strategy in all areas of UKpublic policy. This rich web of linkages arose in response to the problems inherent in the fragmentation arising from hollowing-out. The resulting partnerships bring together public, private, voluntary and community sector actors. They operate between and around the core institutions of democratic government. These tertiary (partnership) structures have complex accountability relationships with primary (elected) and secondary (appointed) public bodies, as well as with other actors. The example of Northshire shows how inter-linked strategic and specific partnership boards create an alternative, collaborative governance structure for a locality which is largely outside democratic processes. This development has fundamental implications for our appreciation of the institutional framework of UK government, as well asfor the debate about andpractice ofdemocratic renewal.},

  abstract = {This study offers a distinctive new account of British economic life since the Second World War, focussing upon the ways in which successive governments, in seeking to manage the economy, have sought simultaneously to 'manage the people': to try and manage popular understanding of economic issues. In doing so, governments have sought not only to shape expectations for electoral purposes but to construct broader narratives about how 'the economy' should be understood. The starting point of this work is to ask why these goals have been focussed upon (and differentially over time), how they have been constructed to appeal to the population, and, insofar as this can be assessed, how far the population has accepted these narratives. The first half of the book analyses the development of the major narratives from the 1940s onwards, addressing the notion of 'austerity' and its particular meaning in the 1940s; the rise of a narrative of 'economic decline from the late 1950s, and the subsequent attempts to 'modernize' the economy; the attempts to 'roll back the state' from the 1970s; the impact of ideas of 'globalization' in the 1900s; and, finally, the way the crisis of 2008/9 onwards was constructed as a problem of 'debts and deficits'. The second part of the book focuses on four key issues in attempts to 'manage the people': productivity, the balance of payments, inflation, and unemployment. It shows how, in each case, governments sought to get the populace to understand these issues in a particular light, and shaped strategies to that end.},

Concern about `national efficiency' following the Boer War prompted a series of important social reforms before the attention of the governing elite was distracted yet again by the Irish Question and then by war. The next thirty years were to be dominated by the internal challenge of Labour and the external challenge of war. The post-war consensus was essentially the product of these two challenges. However, the problem of Britain's relative economic decline which had lain dormant since Edwardian times revived in the late 1950s and rapidly became the dominant factor in British politics. Chapter 4 described how the post-war consensus entered crisis in the mid-1970s under the impact of persistent economic and political failure.
