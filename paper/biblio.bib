This book is the first comprehensive comparison of these two powerful elites. In seven countries--the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, Italy, and the Netherlands--researchers questioned 700 bureaucrats and 6OO politicians in an effort to understand how their aims, attitudes, and ambitions differ within cultural settings. One of the authors' most significant findings is that the worlds of these two elites overlap much more in the United States than in Europe. But throughout the West bureaucrats and politicians each wear special blinders and each have special virtues. In a well-ordered polity, the authors conclude, politicians articulate society's dreams and bureaucrats bring them gingerly to earth.}

The article identifies what we call `deficit trouble', when there is poor alignment of the deficits of different imagined scientists, which may lead to a stalemate in the communication between science policymakers and scientists.

While this work has focused almost exclusively on the modern era, the roots of many of the issues, debates, and institutions under consideration go back many centuries to the early modern period. Reliance upon the practical knowledge and skill of experts was a key factor in enabling early modern states to become more powerful and sophisticated and to construct empires and economies that were global in reach. At the same time, the state was an important source of legitimation and status for the experts who served it. By examining the nature of expertise and its relationship to the early modern state, as both entities evolved together and reinforced one another, historians can acquire a more comprehensive understanding of both.},

The three main conclusions of this article are that: (1) The best performance is still attained with trained human or crowd coding; (2) None of the used dictionaries come close to acceptable levels of validity; and (3) machine learning, especially deep learning, substantially outperforms dictionary-based methods but falls short of human performance. From these findings, we stress the importance of always validating automatic text analysis methods before usage.

In this article, I will show how a group of Dutch intellectuals, including many scientists, came up with an alternative approach to the dilemmas of modernity, and eventually became influential in shaping Dutch society. They combined elements of both styles into what I call a 'synthetic technocrat' ideology, a reaction against intellectual and political fragmentation. These ideas were often combined with pleas for educational reform, culminating in a plea for gebildete Tatkraft. I will analyse the development of the synthetic technocrat movement from the late nineteenth century into the 1940s. During this period, the movement became increasingly political in nature, but in a radically different way to comparable movements in other countries, especially Germany.},

  abstract = {Scientific management: Technology spawned it, Frederick Winslow Taylor championed it, Thorstein Veblen dissected it, Henry Ford implemented it. By the turn of the century, practical visionaries prided themselves on having arrived at "the one best way" both to increase industrial productivity and to regulate the vagaries of human behavior. Nothing escaped the efficiency craze, and in this vivid, wide-ranging book, Martha Banta explores its effect on the culture at large. To the Taylorists, everthing needed tidying up: government, business, warfare, households, and, most of all, the workplace, with its unruly influx of strangers into the native scenes. Taylored Lives gives us a striking sense of what it was like to live, work, love, and die when time, motion, and emotions were checked off on worksheets and management charts. Canvasing the culture, Banta shows how the cause of efficiency was taken up in narratives, of every sort - in mail-order catalogs, popular romances, newspaper stories, and personal testimonials "from below", as well as in the canonical works of writers from Henry Adams and William James, to Sinclair Lewis, Nathanael West, and William Faulkner. The strategies of impassioned theorists and hands-on practitioners affected the kinds-of narratives produced in the controversy over the pros and cons of the management culture; they bear an eerie resemblance to the means by which we today, storytellers all, keep trying to make sense of our own chaotic times. This interdisciplinary work charts the development of a managerial culture from its start in the steel mills of Pennsylvania through its spread across the American experience in an interlocking series of social systems andeveryday practices. Banta scrutinizes narrative strategies employed by "inscribers" as diverse as Josephine Goldmark, Theodore Roosevelt, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Anzia Yezierska, Richard Harding Davis, Booker T. Washington, and Theodore Dreiser; by Taylor himself, as well as Veblen and Ford; by women who toiled on the factory floor; by writers of dream-copy for ready-made houses; and by Buster Keaton in his silent treatment of the dysfuntional honeymoon home. With its historical scope and its provocative readings of assorted narratives, this richly illustrated book offers a complex and disturbing picture of a period, as well as invaluable insights into the way theory-making continually makes and breaks cultures. A remarkable work, Taylored Lives confirms Martha Banta's place as one of our leading cultural and literary critics.},

Its experiments provided a model for future revolutions and democracies across the globe, but this first modern revolution had no model to follow. Using reconstructed transcripts of debates held in the Revolution's first parliament, we present a quantitative analysis of how this body managed innovation. We use information theory to track the creation, transmission, and destruction of word-use patterns across over 40,000 speeches and a thousand speakers. The parliament as a whole was biased toward the adoption of new patterns, but speakers' individual qualities could break these overall trends. Speakers on the left innovated at higher rates, while speakers on the right acted to preserve prior patterns. Key players such as Robespierre (on the left) and Abb\'e Maury (on the right) played information-processing roles emblematic of their politics. Newly created organizational functions\textemdash such as the Assembly president and committee chairs\textemdash had significant effects on debate outcomes, and a distinct transition appears midway through the parliament when committees, external to the debate process, gained new powers to ``propose and dispose.'' Taken together, these quantitative results align with existing qualitative interpretations, but also reveal crucial information-processing dynamics that have hitherto been overlooked. Great orators had the public's attention, but deputies (mostly on the political left) who mastered the committee system gained new powers to shape revolutionary legislation.},

But the discourse of different national parliaments is subject to variation, at all linguistic levels, on the basis of history, cultural specificity, and political culture in particular. Through the use of various analytical tools of functional linguistics, this volume seeks to provide explanatory analyses of parliamentary discourse in different countries  Britain, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Sweden and the United States  and to explore its peculiarities.

It is a blueprint of the "perfect society", a guidebook that stimulated some of the greatest thinkers of our age. John Dewey, Charles Beard, and Edward Weeks, in separate surveys conducted in 1935, listed Edward Bellamy's novel as the most influential work written by an American in the preceding fifty years.

  abstract = {This book represents the first comprehensive study of how technocracy currently challenges representative democracy and asks how technocratic politics undermines democratic legitimacy. How strong is its challenge to democratic institutions?  The book offers a solid theory and conceptualization of technocratic politics and the technocratic challenge is analyzed empirically at all levels of the national and supra-national institutions and actors, such as cabinets, parties, the EU, independent bodies, central banks and direct democratic campaigns in a comparative and policy perspective. It takes an in-depth analysis addressing elitism, meritocracy, de-politicization, efficiency, neutrality, reliance on science and distrust toward party politics and ideologies, and their impact when pitched against democratic responsiveness, accountability, citizens' input and pluralist competition. In the current crisis of democracy, this book assesses the effects of the technocratic critique against representative institutions, which are perceived to be unable to deal with complex and global problems. It analyzes demands for competent and responsible policy making in combination with the simultaneous populist resistance to experts.   The book will be of key interest to scholars and students of comparative politics, political theory, policy analysis, multi-level governance as well as practitioners working in bureaucracies, media, think-tanks and policy making.},

Economic policymakers in Thatcher and Reagan's administrations in the early 1980s did not set out to `fail forwards' by generating a crisis that would enable a statist kind of neoliberalism. The key ideas that they drew on and the policies that they used to put them into practice sought to transform the economy indirectly, through a set of performative policy devices that they believed would generate a dramatic shift in people's inflationary expectations, lowering inflation without provoking a major recession. Archival records make it clear that these efforts were not only a failure, but also one that policymakers were acutely aware of at the time. By examining these quiet failures in economic policy, we can better understand how these governments simultaneously failed in their early efforts to introduce neoliberal economics and yet ultimately succeeded in transforming their economies in important respects \textendash{} and in legitimising those transformations by narrating failure as a kind of inevitable success.},

  abstract = {Democratic Governance examines the changing nature of the modern state and reveals the dangers these changes pose to democracy. Mark Bevir shows how new ideas about governance have gradually displaced old-style notions of government in Britain and around the world. Policymakers cling to outdated concepts of representative government while at the same time placing ever more faith in expertise, markets, and networks. Democracy exhibits blurred lines of accountability and declining legitimacy. Bevir explores how new theories of governance undermined traditional government in the twentieth century. Politicians responded by erecting great bureaucracies, increasingly relying on policy expertise and abstract notions of citizenship and, more recently, on networks of quasi-governmental and private organizations to deliver services using market-oriented techniques. Today, the state is an unwieldy edifice of nineteenth-century government buttressed by a sprawling substructure devoted to the very different idea of governance--and democracy has suffered. In Democratic Governance, Bevir takes a comprehensive look at governance and the history and thinking behind it. He provides in-depth case studies of constitutional reform, judicial reform, joined-up government, and police reform. He argues that the best hope for democratic renewal lies in more interpretive styles of expertise, dialogic forms of policymaking, and more diverse avenues for public participation.},

  title = {The Rise of the Technopopulists},
  author = {Bickerton, Christopher},
  year = {2020},
  month = oct,
  abstract = {A few days before it was announced there would be a nationwide UK lockdown from late March, Sky News political editor Beth Rigby remarked on an unexpected shift in the Prime Minister's behaviour. Struck by the importance Boris Johnson was attaching to scientific advice, Rigby mused that a populist politician seemed to be taking a non-populist approach to the crisis. The embrace of science has persisted throughout the pandemic. As well as justifying government decisions in the language of scientific advice, the country's chief medical officers and scientific advisers \textendash{} from Chris Whitty and Jenny Harries to the ill-fated epidemiologist Neil Ferguson \textendash{} have been leading actors in the British coronavirus drama.  From the outset, arguments about rival scientific models dominated political discussion. The ``herd immunity'' approach was popular early on but lost out to the suppression strategy promoted by Ferguson at Imperial College London. With the exception of Johnson's chief aide, Dominic Cummings, Downing Street has come down hard on anyone breaching Covid-19 restrictions. Johnson's determination to follow the advice of his scientists has created an opportunity for the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to present himself as less risk-averse and more attuned to the dangers that the pandemic poses for Britain's economy.  Experienced observers of British politics are right to be confused. After becoming Prime Minister in July last year, Johnson reaffirmed his status as the country's leading populist. He attached ``the people'' as a prefix to almost every dimension of his premiership. After pitting ``the people against parliament'' in his general election campaign, he created ``a people's government''. Having packed the House of Commons with his own MPs, Johnson called it ``the people's parliament''. The March 2020 Budget was ``the people's Budget''. This confusion stems from our expectation that promises to do what ``the people'' want will clash with appeals to expertise and competence. We think of populism and technocracy as opposites, not as complements. There are good reasons to believe in this opposition. The conflict between technocracy and democracy takes us back to Plato, who argued that we should think of the polis or ideal city in the same way as we think of the individual household, the oikos. Running a household requires skills, techne, and we expect those with the skills to be in charge. Similarly, we should put the ``philosopher kings'' in charge of running the polis. Technocracy is therefore skill (techne) plus power (kratos). The industrial age recast the meaning of technocracy in a way that tied it more closely to the liberating potential of modern technology. In the 18th century, the French social theorist Henri de Saint-Simon first proposed power be taken away from politicians and given to engineers. This idea exists today among tech enthusiasts in Silicon Valley. Empowering experts seems to imply the demobilisation of ``the people''. The opposition between populism and technocracy also makes sense because it confirms those who put their faith in technocratic forms of decision-making. Johnson's critics often remark rather smugly that a former Have I Got News For You panellist was never going to be able to handle a global pandemic. The failures of Donald Trump, Johnson and Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro in tackling Covid-19 have led to a crescendo of voices decrying the policy failures of populists. By contrast, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel \textendash{} who has a doctorate in quantum chemistry \textendash{} is celebrated for her seriousness of purpose. Placing populism and technocracy in opposition like this is a way of attacking those voters who elected the populists in the first place. We cannot understand the contemporary political moment if we stick to this opposition between populism and technocracy. Political competition in advanced democratic states today is increasingly ordered around appeals to both ``the people'' and to competence and expertise. Far from clashing with one another, these appeals are combined in multiple and complex ways. We cannot say that one party or leader is populist while another is more technocratic. Rather, political strategies involve various combinations of populism and technocracy. In short, we live in a technopopulist age. The crucial difference with the traditional understanding of technocracy is that technopopulism does not describe a shift of decision-making power from political entities to independent bodies. This sort of depoliticisation still exists, of course, but technopopulism is something different. It is not an alternative to democracy; it is the form that democratic politics takes today. We have been accustomed to viewing political competition as a struggle between left and right. We should think about it instead as competition between rival ways of synthesising appeals to ``the people'' and appeals to expertise. **** The Conservatives' election-winning slogan of 2019 \textendash{} ``Get Brexit Done'' \textendash{} was powerfully technopopulist. It was a promise to do ``what the people want'', namely, leave the European Union \textendash{} but it was also a promise to do it promptly and efficiently. The pledge to act entailed a claim about competence and expertise, which fed off a growing disillusionment with the stalemate in the House of Commons. The Labour Party's response to this slogan \textendash{} ``Get Brexit Right'' \textendash{} is itself firmly rooted in the technopopulist register. Keir Starmer pits his promise of precision against Johnson's promise of swiftness, but both entail claims to a form of political competence. The concept of technopopulism helps to unravel the mystery of Dominic Cummings's centrality to the Johnson government and the manner in which he became the object of public opprobrium in May this year, after revelations about his trips to the north-east during lockdown. Cummings ruminates obsessively about the potential of cutting-edge science and technology to improve government performance; he writes rambling blog posts on the 17th-century German polymath Leibniz and the Apollo space programme; he is waging a war against the civil service. At the same time, Cummings is Britain's arch-populist agitator. In 2004, he was instrumental in the campaign against the Labour government's proposal for a North East Assembly. His winning slogans \textendash{} ``vote no to more politicians'' and ``politicians talk, we pay'' \textendash{} capitalised on public distrust of the political class and were precursors to the Leave campaign in 2016. In the early autumn of 2019, Cummings was a key figure in pushing the government towards its showdown with parliament, arguing that the Commons and the Lords had become obstacles to the exercise of popular sovereignty. Cummings thus in many ways embodies this new combination of populism and technocracy. **** Technopopulism is not just a British story. In the United States, Donald Trump's coruscating attacks on expert opinion belie a more nuanced set of developments. When he ran against Hillary Clinton in 2016, it was common to view the contest as that of a populist against a seasoned and highly competent politician. And yet, Trump's political persona made much of his practical ability to do deals and ``get the job done'', in contrast to his Democratic predecessor. Trump has, perhaps, most in common with Italy's Silvio Berlusconi. Derided by outside observers, Berlusconi successfully cultivated a personal and direct relationship with Italians via television and by politicising his entrepreneurial success. At the core of Italian politics under Berlusconi, as with Trump, has been this amalgamation of a personal bond with citizens and a managerial approach to politics. While much has been written about the dangers of this overlapping of money with politics, we should pay as much attention to the exact meanings of expertise and popular representation contained in Berlusconism or Trumpism. Since the coronavirus pandemic began, Trump's strategy has not been to dismiss all expert opinion out of hand. Instead, he has deployed ``his'' experts. He has also made much of his ability to read data and provide his own interpretations. Political debate in the United States has been along the lines of ``my expert versus yours'', not a simple clash between populism and technocracy.  Flanked by experts: Anthony Fauci, Mike Pence and Donald Trump face the press, February 2020. Credit: Alex Wong / Getty  Variations in technopopulism therefore come from different ways of mobilising ``the people'' and by focusing on different understandings of techne. Elected in 2017, French president Emmanuel Macron's attack on the political class and his unabashedly messianic political style had all the hallmarks of the populist politician. In a striking instance of the populist's personalised approach to exercising power, Macron even gave his political movement the same initials as himself: En Marche!. But Macron was also a product of France's statist and elitist technocratic system. He used the language of competence to attack his opponents. A key turning point in the last presidential election was the second televised debate on 3 May 2017, when far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen made a series of factual errors culminating in an incoherent account of how she would take France out of the euro. In his response, Macron chided Le Pen in the manner of a teacher disappointed at his student's poor performance. You could at least have prepared for this debate rather than trying to wing it, he scolded. Le Pen never recovered. Macron's brand of technopopulism is unabashedly top-down. He thinks of himself as the people's problem-solver. His concept of techne, drawn from the upper echelons of the French meritocracy, is put to the service of ``the people''. As Macron argued in his memoir-cum-political programme, Revolution, ``the French are less interested in representation than in action. They want politicians to be efficient, and that's all there is to it.'' In recent months, Macron has had to recalibrate the balance between his populist and technocratic components. His decision this summer to change his prime minister was a way of forging a more direct and ``human'' connection with voters. In place of the stiff and technocratic \'Edouard Philippe, Macron chose Jean Castex \textendash{} a mayor of a small town in the south of France, who speaks with a southern accent and has the popular touch his predecessor lacked. Italy's Five Star Movement (M5S) is a bottom-up form of technopopulism. Currently in a coalition government with the centre-left Democratic Party, the M5S is usually associated with its charismatic founder, Beppe Grillo, a comedian-turned-politician who built a popular movement out of anger and frustration at Italian political life. Grillo's promise to do away with the political caste and replace it with a more direct form of democracy was enormously successful: founded in 2009 as a small online movement, in the 2013 general election the M5S received more votes than any other party. Grillo's anti-establishment message galvanised a generation of political discontents, but the M5S is not a purely populist movement. The ``five stars'' refer to the movement's central goals of environmentalism, internet connectivity, and sustainable water, transport and development. These are concrete policy ambitions, not grand ideological principles. The philosophy behind the M5S, articulated by the web guru and co-founder Gianroberto Casaleggio, was that the internet and digital connectivity were a means of harnessing the ``collective intelligence'' of humanity. Direct democracy through the web was the route to better policymaking. As Casaleggio once put it, ``the web makes us equal in being smart.'' The Five Star Movement thus combines populism and technocracy by arguing everyone is an expert. The internet and direct citizen participation help pool the knowledge and competence of the general population. Citizens are at the heart of the M5S, but as holders of knowledge rather than as bearers of rights. Dominic Cummings's demand on 2 January this year that ``weirdos and misfits'' apply for jobs in No 10 had something of Grillo and Casaleggio to it. But British technopopulism relies on a traditional party structure and eschews Italian experiments with digital democracy. **** The language of expertise and competence is almost as old as democracy itself. The same is true of ``the people'' and attempts to mobilise popular will. So what exactly has changed? From the middle of the 19th century until the final years of the 20th century, democratic politics was about a clash between rival ideologies: between the left and the right. These ideologies were not devices deployed by cynical politicians. They were the building blocks of society, taking precedence over general appeals to ``the people'' or to the competence of politicians and their advisers. The clash of ideologies was embodied in the most significant creation of the early 20th century, the mass party of the left and of the right. As Hans Fallada put it in Alone in Berlin (1947), his celebrated novel about resistance to Nazi rule in wartime Berlin: ``The party was everything, and the people nothing.'' Ideologies were more than political rhetoric; they gave societies their substance and structure. Conservative and Labour traditions in the UK were a way of life, as were Christian democracy and social democracy in Germany or Italy. In the Netherlands, ideology divided society so much that the country's social structure was imagined as a series of independent pillars, existing side by side but never overlapping. Life in a pillar was all-encompassing, taking in your football club, your school, your preferred newspaper and even the caf\'e at which you would drink and socialise. As the structuring power of rival ideologies has declined, so the force of ``the people'' as a political slogan has grown. Individualism has eroded these distinctive social groups, leaving political parties without any roots. As free-floating politicians, they coin empty slogans in the hope of winning over as many voters as possible. The prominence of competence and expertise in our political vocabulary has its origins in the rise of meritocracy, what political scientists like to call ``cognitive mobilisation''. By investing intellectual ability with a moral superiority, many of those near the top of the meritocratic ladder feel justified in demanding that politicians should resemble themselves. Synthesising these appeals to ``the people'' and to expertise gives us technopopulism \textendash{} the new political logic of our age. **** If technopopulism is the key to making sense of Johnsonism as a political philosophy, it is also the way we can grasp its weakness and superficiality. At the time of the electoral victory in late 2019, there was much talk of a fundamental ideological reordering of British politics, one where working-class voters of the north of England were willing \textendash{} for the first time in their lives \textendash{} to vote Conservative. Cummings and others around him in Downing Street spoke grandly of a new social contract. Less than a year later, it has all come apart, dramatically so. Johnson cuts a lonely figure and there is talk about him quitting in the New Year. The most discontented on the Tory back benches include those from so-called Red Wall seats, where expectations about a ``levelling up'' agenda are highest. The origins of technopopulism as a political logic lie in a separation of politics from society. Ideologies provided the glue that kept social groups and political representatives together. As this glue has disappeared, a gap has opened up between voters and governments. Technopopulism is more a consequence of this void than it is a way of filling it. As a result, politics is no longer a reflection of shifting class cleavages and social structures. It is far more superficial and disconnected than that. Technopopulism as a political logic means politicians can \textendash{} simultaneously \textendash{} appeal to all voters while promising them magical technocratic fixes that are ``right'' or ``true'', and do not involve trading the interests of one group against the interests of another. But we should not equate an individualised and atomised society with an equal society. Deep conflicts of interest persist even if they are not utilised in the old ways. Technopopulism is thus a product of the void between voters and their politicians, and its practitioners are constantly being undone by this void. It is a persistent form of politics, but also a deeply unstable one. One important source of instability is that politicising expertise erodes its authority, which stems precisely from being ``outside'' of politics. The trouble with politicising expertise is that we quickly realise there is no necessary or direct connection between what we know and what we ought to do. This has been one of the great lessons of the pandemic. Simply ``following the science'' cannot work because scientific evidence and models are themselves both open to question and fall far short of providing instructions about what to do in any given set of circumstances. At the heart of politics is the need to make decisions based not only on facts but also on a set of beliefs that provide a framework for action. Stripped of an ideological outlook that contains within it some vision of future society, decision-making dissolves into problem-solving. This leads to the endless firefighting and U-turns that have characterised the British response to Covid-19. The relative success of the German response to the pandemic is not because of a stronger technocratic commitment to ``following the science''. It is simply because of the structure of the German state. Its federal model \textendash{} with substantial powers given to the individual states or L\"ander \textendash{} meant that the test and trace system developed early on in the pandemic came from the bottom-up, using private and public laboratories, and tracing capacity was built up by individual municipalities. At the same time, the country has continued to fund its welfare state, focusing on healthcare because of its ageing population. The decentralised structure of the German state and the quality of its health system are nothing to do with scientific expertise as such; they reflect the social settlements of the past and the present. There is something self-defeating about trying to make truth the foundation of political action, whether it be the truth of ``the people'' or the truth provided by expert knowledge. The anti-Trump ``truth campaigns'' in the US led by the New York Times (``the truth isn't red or blue\ldots{} the truth is hard\ldots{} the truth is under attack''), have failed because deploying truth as a political weapon strips it of the objectivity that made it politically valuable in the first place. There is no truth in politics. There is only the balance of social forces that dictates the way in which we interpret our political and social world. What matters is the power that comes from being able to build coalitions and majorities strong enough to implement a political programme. An appeal to ``the people'' is also an unstable and fragile source of political authority. Brexit is a useful lesson here. The demand that the government trigger Article 50 immediately after the June 2016 referendum was justified as being ``what the people want''. The gap between this appeal to popular will and the lack of a defined plan for the UK's exit from the EU was wide enough to shape events long after the vote had taken place. The difficulty of filling it ended Theresa May's premiership and locked the UK into a negotiating process where the options were limited by the ticking clock started by triggering Article 50. Behind any appeal to ``what the people want'' lies the need to transform popular will into a political platform with actual social content. For over a century, political parties have done this while working within the rules of representative democracy. But parties can only do this if they are a bridge between society and politics. **** The pandemic has demonstrated how wide the gap can be between what Rousseau called the will of all and the general will. The will of all refers to the will of everyone in the political community; the general will is more complex, usually going against the individual interests of some members of the community. When competence and government performance are all that we discuss in relation to Covid-19, we neglect the much more difficult discussion of how we should manage the conflicts of interest that run through our societies. For instance, what of the inter-generational transfer of wealth that comes with an approach focused on saving the lives of the most vulnerable, but paid for by the least vulnerable? These are the sorts of deeper political questions that we should be discussing and worrying about, but our technopopulist age reduces political debate to a synthesis of appeals to ``the people'' and to expertise. This political logic has its roots in the decline of class-based identities and in a moralised celebration of competence, one of the worst features of our meritocratic societies. Technopopulism is unstable and unappealing, but it is likely to be with us for some time to come.  Chris Bickerton teaches politics at the University of Cambridge. His book on technopopulism, written with Carlo Invernizzi Accetti, will be published by Oxford University Press early next year},

This article argues that whilst these two terms \textendash{} and the political realities they refer to \textendash{} are usually assumed to be irreducibly opposed to one another, there is also an important element of complementarity between them. This complementarity consists in the fact that both populism and technocracy are predicated upon an implicit critique of a specific political form, referred to in this article as `party democracy'. This is defined as a political regime based on two key features: the mediation of political conflicts through the institution of political parties and a procedural conception of political legitimacy according to which political outcomes are legitimate to the extent that they are the product of a set of democratic procedures revolving around the principles of parliamentary deliberation and electoral competition. This argument is made through a close analysis of works by Ernesto Laclau and Pierre Rosanvallon, chosen as exemplary manifestations of the contemporary cases for populism and technocracy, respectively.},

Initially dismissed as protest movements, both point to broader structural transformations taking place within the region's political systems. Focusing on three dominant notions in the literature, `anti-system', `anti-establishment' and `populist' party types, this article critically discusses each of these conceptual categories. It finds that none of them captures the originality of these movements, namely their combination of `populist' and `technocratic' conceptions of politics and modes of presentation. Revisiting the term `techno-populism,' this article recasts it as a new party family. As well as shedding light on the distinctive nature of the M5S and Podemos, this article aims to contribute to defining a broader `ideal-type' of techno-populism, which can serve as the basis for a new research agenda combining work on technocracy, populism and political parties.},

The reforms attempted can be placed within a long British socialist tradition, flavoured by Fabian elitism and containing intellectual contradictions. The ideological basis for the objectives being pursued, such as economic expansion, was never properly explored or developed. Harold Wilson's Civil Service `revolution' was not entirely original, nor complete, nor fully successful. But some of his innovations, such as the incorporation of more outsiders into Whitehall, the first use of special advisers, and the establishment of the Ministry of Overseas Development and the Welsh Office, did last. Certain features of Tony Blair's approach to Whitehall, such as the deployment of special advisers and attempts to co-ordinate government and communications more fully from the centre, are reminiscent of the Wilson period. The resilience of the Treasury was apparent through both premierships. An unusual continuity can be traced between attempts to plan growth under Wilson and targets for improvements and reform in public services under Blair.},

  abstract = {Selected as a Financial Times Best Book of 2013Governments today in both Europe and the United States have succeeded in casting government spending as reckless wastefulness that has made the economy worse. In contrast, they have advanced a policy of draconian budget cuts\textemdash austerity\textemdash to solve the financial crisis. We are told that we have all lived beyond our means and now need to tighten our belts. This view conveniently forgets where all that debt came from. Not from an orgy of government spending, but as the direct result of bailing out, recapitalizing, and adding liquidity to the broken banking system. Through these actions private debt was rechristened as government debt while those responsible for generating it walked away scot free, placing the blame on the state, and the burden on the taxpayer. That burden now takes the form of a global turn to austerity, the policy of reducing domestic wages and prices to restore competitiveness and balance the budget. The problem, according to political economist Mark Blyth, is that austerity is a very dangerous idea. First of all, it doesn't work. As the past four years and countless historical examples from the last 100 years show, while it makes sense for any one state to try and cut its way to growth, it simply cannot work when all states try it simultaneously: all we do is shrink the economy. In the worst case, austerity policies worsened the Great Depression and created the conditions for seizures of power by the forces responsible for the Second World War: the Nazis and the Japanese military establishment. As Blyth amply demonstrates, the arguments for austerity are tenuous and the evidence thin. Rather than expanding growth and opportunity, the repeated revival of this dead economic idea has almost always led to low growth along with increases in wealth and income inequality. Austerity demolishes the conventional wisdom, marshaling an army of facts to demand that we austerity for what it is, and what it costs us.},

Blyth analyzes the 1930s and 1970s, two periods of deep-seated institutional change that characterized the twentieth century. Viewing both periods of change as part of the same dynamic, Blyth argues that the 1930s labor reacted against the exigencies of the market and demanded state action to mitigate the market's effects by "embedding liberalism" and the 1970s, those who benefited least from such "embedding" institutions, namely business, reacted against these constraints and sought to overturn that institutional order. In Great Transformations, Blyth demonstrates the critical role economic ideas played in making institutional change possible and he rethinks the relationship between uncertainty, ideas, and interests on how, and under what conditions, institutional change takes place. Mark Blyth is an assistant professor of political science at the Johns Hopkins University specializing in comparative political economy. He has taught at Columbia University, and at the University of Birmingham, UK. Blyth is a member of the editorial board of the Review of International Political Economy.},

This creates a paradox as both logics cannot be simultaneously true. However, it is a generative paradox insofar as the power of the policy paradigms framework emerges, in part, from this attempt to straddle these distinct positions, producing an argument that is greater than the sum of its parts. In the second part of the article, I discuss the recent global financial crisis, an area where we should see third-order change, but we do no not. That we do not strengthens the case for the constructivist causal story.},

It sank intoan almost complete oblivion during the twentieth, when it was eclipsedby neopositivism. However, Comte's decision to developsuccessively a philosophy of mathematics, a philosophy of physics, aphilosophy of chemistry and a philosophy of biology, makes him thefirst philosopher of science in the modern sense, and his constantattention to the social dimension of science resonates in manyrespects with current points of view. His political philosophy, on theother hand, is even less known, because it differs substantially fromthe classical political philosophy we have inherited., Comte's most important works are (1) the Course on PositivePhilosophy (1830\textendash 1842, six volumes, translated and condensed byHarriet Martineau as The Positive Philosophy of AugusteComte); (2) the System of Positive Polity, or Treatise onSociology, Instituting the Religion of Humanity, (1851\textendash 1854, fourvolumes); and (3) the Early Writings (1820\textendash 1829), where onecan see the influence of Saint-Simon, for whom Comte served assecretary from 1817 to 1824. The Early Writings are still thebest introduction to Comte's thought. In the Course, Comtesaid, science was transformed into philosophy; in the System, philosophy was transformed into religion. The secondtransformation met with strong opposition; as a result, it has becomecustomary to distinguish, with Mill, between a ``goodComte'' (the author of the Course) and a ``badComte'' (the author of the System). Today's commonconception of positivism corresponds mainly to what can be found inthe Course.},

We find that TCs are more likely to occur in political systems not trusted by the citizens and in systems with poor economic performance. TCs are also systematically more likely to occur when the previous cabinet was dismissed by the president or when it fell due to a political scandal. Contrary to our initial expectations, TCs appear to be more likely in countries with institutionally weaker presidents, other things equal.},

This erosion is ongoing in a multiplicity of contexts, from the environmentalist movements which enlist or dispute expert knowledge to the judicial authorities.

In these lectures, Foucault examines the art or activity of government both in its present form and within a historical perspective as well as the different ways governmentality has been made thinkable and practicable.Foucault's thoughts on political discourse and governmentality are supplemented by the essays of internationally renowned scholars. United by the common influence of Foucault's approach, they explore the many modern manifestations of government: the reason of state, police, liberalism, security, social economy, insurance, solidarity, welfare, risk management, and more. The central theme is that the object and the activity of government are not instinctive and natural things, but things that have been invented and learned.The Foucault Effect analyzes the thought behind practices of government and argues that criticism represents a true force for change in attitudes and actions, and that extending the limits of some practices allows the invention of others. This unique and extraordinarily useful collection of articles and primary materials will open the way for a whole new set of discussions of the work of Michel Foucault as well as the status of liberalism, social policy, and insurance.},

In summary, it argues that the Blair government has fused aspects of traditional economic management with new initiatives to create a powerful tool of governing organised on the basis of the principle of depoliticisation. Depoliticisation as a governing strategy is the process of placing at one remove the political character of decision-making. State managers retain arm's-length control over crucial economic and social processes whilst simultaneously benefiting from the distancing effects of depoliticisation. As a form of politics it seeks to change market expectations regarding the effectiveness and credibility of policy-making in addition to shielding the government from the consequences of unpopular policies.},

It is less exclusionary than nativist or economic forms of populisms and its broad appeal is therefore arguably more threatening to representative democracy. In order to understand the appeal of technocratic populism, as well as why it arises at critical junctures when dominant ideologies are in turmoil, we argue that one must not ignore its historical roots, which shows that it transcends both regime changes and the traditional left?right divide. The article develops and examines these points using evidence from communist-era populist campaigns against ?elitist? dissidents (from Charter 77) in the Czech Republic, and demonstrates how post-1989 politicians have exploited and also adapted ideas and strategies from the authoritarian past for the new democratic setting. The article highlights the adaptive character of technocratic populism across political regimes.},

It argues that populist and technocratic principles of representation challenge fundamental features of party democracy. The two alternative forms of representation are addressed theoretically from the perspective of political representation. First, the article identifies the commonalities between the two forms of representation: both populism and technocracy are based on a unitary, nonpluralist, unmediated, and unaccountable vision of society's general interest. Second, it highlights their differences. Technocracy stresses responsibility and requires voters to entrust authority to experts who identify the general interest from rational speculation. Populism stresses responsiveness and requires voters to delegate authority to leaders who equate the general interest with a putative will of the people. While the populist form of representation has received considerable attention, the technocratic one has been neglected. The article presents a more complete picture of the analytical relationship between them.},

Further government initiatives included the Citizen's Charter which aimed to improve public services by empowering the service user, setting out standards and providing arrangements for compensation when standards were not met. An Office of Public Service and Science was established in 1992 to oversee implementation of the Charter policy across government, and the government's Charter Mark initiative recognised excellence in providers of public services.},

The Next Steps agencies reform, begun by the Thatcher Government and continued during the Major administration, had the potential for making accountability stronger in the areas in which they operated, and performance management produced a permanent evolution towards a government by measurement. The legal framework of the Civil Service was revised to include the Civil Service Management Code, as well as the Code of Conduct for Special Advisers. A process of codification was undertaken in order to protect administrative traditions and constitutional conventions. Problem related to ministerial responsibility raised for the changing of bureaucratic organization. These issues are analyzed by the author and in the conclusions the relationship between administrative traditions and managerial modernization is enhanced as a characteristic of these three decades.},

Focusing on economists within government bureaucracy, the study is based on a quantitative analysis of a large-scale survey of Norwegian ministerial civil servants. It finds that economists are more likely to hold technocratic role perceptions than officials with other educational backgrounds only if they work in the finance ministry or in higher administrative grades. The findings contribute to scholarship on the political sway of economists and to debates about technocracy and the technocratic views of civil servants.},

  abstract = {The extent to which new governments appoint and dismiss senior public servants is widely claimed to be influenced by their country's underlying administrative tradition. This is particularly the case within the Westminster tradition where such turnover is limited in nature, with most appointees coming from within the ranks of the public service. This article challenges the assertion that turnover in the Westminster tradition is homogeneously internal. Theorizing that new governments appoint senior public servants to increase their control over the bureaucracy, and that the desire for control is negatively correlated to trust, this article develops hypotheses between the trust new governments harbour towards the bureaucracy and whether they appoint and dismiss bureaucrats from within or outside the public service. The hypotheses are tested with longitudinal data measuring internal and external appointments and departures to the senior public service in Canada's provincial governments over a period of 18\,years. The results from various multinomial regression models suggest that political appointments to the public service are not as homogenous as frequently suggested. Although a transition in the governing party and a newly elected premier from the same party of the previous government both lead to an increase in bureaucratic turnover, a newly elected first minister has a greater incidence of internal turnover than a change in party, meanwhile the level of external turnover does not meaningfully differ between these two political events.},

  abstract = {By analysing the policies and ideas of German social democracy, the British Labour Party and the Italian Communist Party, this article explores their attitude towards science and their imagination of the future in the 1950s. Deeply different, social democrats and communists shared a positivist attitude in favour of scientific progress and high modernity. This painted their attitude towards the space race, peaceful nuclear power and automation. Science was conceived as a neutral power to be supported, but it required political guidance to harness it and turned it into social progress. Thus, their disagreement was over the political implications for capitalist societies experiencing growing prosperity. Science was also a powerful rhetorical argument to castigate the conservatives for failing the nation and allowing it to decline and fall behind its competitors. The article combines comparison and transnational history, innovating the latter by introducing the concepts of horizontal, vertical and antagonistic transnationalism.},

By examining the American political tradition, they claim that moderation is neither a panacea nor a substitute for pragmatic partisanship. Moderation does have significant advantages: it can promote a form of civic pragmatism capable of dealing with inequalities and justice; it enables us to balance and redress the imbalances in society; and it spans across religions and moral traditions. As such, it fosters dialogue, respect for others, toleration and solidarity. They conclude that moderation is a virtue which is simultaneously necessary (in light of the overwhelming historical experience and the fact that we have lived until recently in a world of extremes), limited and difficult to practice (because moderation requires judgement and lacks a precise algorithm or manual that could teach it to those willing to learn it). Moderation is, as Joseph Hall put it four centuries ago, `the silken string running through the pearl-chain of all virtues'.},

Using a combination of rational choice theory and historical analysis he traces the development of industrial relations and looks at the causes of these differences since the 1870s, seeking long-term historical explanations for more contemporary institutions. - ;In some western European countries trade unions and employers' organizations share responsibility with government for maintaining order and efficiency in the labour market as a matter of course. In others such a role is seen as an unacceptable interference with either the free market or the prerogatives of the state, or both. How can we explain these differences? How enduring are they? Do they matter? In the 1970s there seemed to be a growing popularity for the first approach, leading to the explosion of interest in neo-corporatism; did all that evaporate during the ostensibly neo-liberal 1980s? Colin Crouch tries to answer these questions with reference to fifteen western European nations. Using a combination of rational choice theory and historical analysis he traces the development of industrial relations systems in these countries from the 1870s to the present. He ends by seeking explanations for differences further back in time, showing that longer-term historical explanations of contemporary institutions are more necessary than most exercises in policy analysis prefer to accept. -},

  abstract = {Standard histories of European integration emphasize the immediate aftermath of World War II as the moment when the seeds of the European Union were first sown. However, the interwar years witnessed a flurry of concern with the reconstruction of the world order, generating arguments that cut across the different social sciences, then plunged in a period of disciplinary soul-searching and feverish activism. Economics was no exception: several of the most prominent interwar economists, such as F. A. Hayek, Jan Tinbergen, Lionel Robbins, Fran\c{c}ois Perroux, J. M. Keynes and Robert Triffin, contributed directly to larger public discussions on peace, order and stability. This edited volume combines these different strands of historical narrative into a unified framework, showing how political economy was integral to the interwar literature on international relations and, conversely, how economists were eager to incorporate international politics into their own concerns. The book brings together a group of scholars with varied disciplinary backgrounds, whose combined perspectives allow us to explore three analytical layers. The first part studies how different forms of economic knowledge, from economic programming to international finance, were used in the quest for a stable European order. The second part focuses on the existence of conflicting expectations about the role of social scientific knowledge, either as a source of technical solutions or as an input for enlightened public discussion. The third part illustrates how certain ideas and beliefs found concrete expression in specific institutional settings, which amplified their political leverage. The three parts are enclosed by an introductory essay, laying out the broad topics explored in the volume, and a substantial postscript tying all the historical threads together.},

In an overview of approaches to political moderation they distinguish political moderation as a moral virtue, an effect of an institutional order, an aspect of sociological relations, and moderation as an ideology. They discuss the methodology of conceptual analysis and serial contextualism as a way to identify the varieties of political moderation. In the end, they ask whether political moderation is a recurrent pattern in the search for a way out of extreme conflict, or also an independent ideological tradition. Thus introducing the contributions to the volume, they conclude that political moderation as an ideology of the middle, or third way, is highly vulnerable to moral and political critique.},

  abstract = {Until the sixties a salient feature of Dutch society was its 'pillarization', the segmentation of society in religious and secular blocs and subcultures. Each bloc had set up a whole array of organizations encompassing practically every sphere of social life. In the last three decades a number of both structural and cultural developments set in a process of depillarization. Based on longitudinal Dutch survey data -- covering the 1958-1992 period -- subjective identification with formerly pillarized ideologies is analyzed. It is found that identification has indeed diminished substantially, though primarily with religious ideologies. This article primarily addresses the issue of whether deconfessionalization or de-ideologization is the prime mover behind the decline of pillarized ideological identifications. It is found that in the first stages of depillarization deconfessionalization of Dutch society induced a process towards a decline of pillarized religious self-perceptions, while identification with pillarized secular attitudes remained rather stable. In more recent years de-ideologization became more prominent. Furthermore, it is observed that changes in ideological self-perceptions are particularly to be found among confessional groups who have become both smaller in number and less convinced of beliefs and behaviors traditionally linked with pillarized ideologies.},

Whereas these discourses are historically distinct the 2008 financial crisis and the 2011 wave of struggles have precipitated the political conditions for their intersection and hybridization. Such convergence produces both tensions and possibilities. On the one hand, technopopulism engenders a radically participatory model of democracy, which is ultimately anti-institutional as citizens cooperate and engage in sophisticated decision-making without the mediation of professional politicians. On the other hand, the more successful technopopulist parties\textemdash at least in the electoral arena\textemdash are all led by charismatic leaders who synthesize the positions that emerge from the netroots to mobilize them against the establishment. These two seemingly contradictory aspects precipitate in two variants of technopopulism: a leaderless-technocratic variant, which is derived from the open source mode of governance and from early experiments of the Global Justice Movement in networked self-government; and a leaderist-populist variant, which is more strictly focused on the electoral competition as an intrinsically reductive and thus hegemonic practice. The article concludes with a reflection on the discursive complementarity of these two variants and on the political tensions and challenges technopopulism faces in the current phase.},

Much of this interest was shared by Labour's Richard Crossman, who had himself previously written scholarly analyses of the deficiencies of Parliament, and had proposed reforms to reverse its apparent decline and marginalisation. Crossman was granted a unique opportunity to give practical effect to his proposals when he was appointed Leader of the House in 1966, but he enjoyed only limited success, due largely to the fact that few of his senior Labour colleagues shared his enthusiasm for reform, particularly once they had risen to Ministerial rank, and thus enjoyed the power and privileges this bestowed upon them. Many Ministers also failed to discern a link between parliamentary reform and reversal of Britain's economic decline. On the contrary, the economic problems confronting the 1964\textendash 1970 Labour Governments were widely viewed as necessitating stronger action from the centre, and this would hardly be achieved by devolving power to, or sharing it with, backbench MPs in the House of Commons.},

  abstract = {In Westminster systems, governments enjoy strong agenda-setting powers but are accountable to an inquisitorial opposition. This article provides insights into the origins of this arrangement from the British House of Commons, drawing primarily on a new data set of a half million parliamentary speeches. We show that, according to a novel measure we develop, government ministers became more responsive to opposition members of parliament in the same period that the government's agenda power was most conclusively strengthened\textemdash roughly, the two decades culminating in Balfour's ``railway timetable'' of 1902. We argue that this increase in responsiveness helps to explain why opposition members of parliament acceded to reductions in their procedural power. We thus highlight a link between government strength and opposition scrutiny in the historical development of the Westminster system.},

G\o sta Esping-Andersen, one of the foremost contributors to current debates on this issue, here provides a new analysis of the character and role of welfare states in the functioning of contemporary advanced Western societies. Esping-Andersen distinguishes three major types of welfare state, connecting these with variations in the historical development of different Western countries. He argues that current economic processes, such as those moving toward a postindustrial order, are shaped not by autonomous market forces but by the nature of states and state differences. Fully informed by comparative materials, this book will have great appeal to all those working on issues of economic development and postindustrialism. Its audience will include students of sociology, economics, and politics.},

  month = dec,
  publisher = {{Oxford University Press}},
  abstract = {Technocrats claim to know how to solve the social and economic problems of complex modern societies. But as Jeffrey Friedman argues in Power without Knowledge, there is a fundamental flaw with technocracy: it requires an ability to predict how the people whom technocrats attempt to control will act in response to technocratic policies. However, the mass public's ideas-the ideas that drive their actions-are far too varied and diverse to be reliably predicted. But that is not the only problem. Friedman reminds us that a large part of contemporary mass politics, even populist mass politics, is essentially technocratic too. Members of the general public often assume that they are competent to decide which policies or politicians will be able to solve social and economic problems. Yet these ordinary "citizen-technocrats" typically regard the solutions to social problems as self-evident, such that politics becomes a matter of vetting public officials for their good intentions and strong wills, not their technocratic expertise. Finally, Friedman argues that technocratic experts themselves drastically oversimplify technocratic realities. Economists, for example, theorize that people respond rationally to the incentives they face. This theory is simplistic, but it gives the appearance of being able to predict people's behavior in response to technocratic policy initiatives. If stripped of such gross oversimplications, though, technocrats themselves would be forced to admit that a rational technocracy is nothing more than an impossible dream. Ranging widely over the philosophy of social science, rational choice theory, and empirical political science, Power without Knowledge is a pathbreaking work that upends traditional assumptions about technocracy and politics, forcing us to rethink our assumptions about the legitimacy of modern governance.},

A broad range of concise essays by European and American scholars demonstrates how some of America`s most well-known and influential novels responded to and participated in the radical transformations that characterized American culture between the early republic and the age of imperial expansion. Part I consists of 7 systematic essays on key historical and critical frameworks \rule{1em}{1pt} including debates aboutrace and citizenship, transnationalism, environmentalism and print culture, as well as sentimentalism, romance and the gothic, realism and naturalism. Part II provides 22 essays on individual novels, each combining an introduction to relevant cultural contexts with a fresh close reading and the discussion of critical perspectives shaped by literary and cultural theory.},

The method centers around the notion of `argumentative adpositional adtree' (`arg-adtree'). After an explanation of the two frameworks involved, the method is illustrated by providing the arg-adtrees of two concrete examples of so-called `first-order arguments'. It is argued that the resulting ad-trees provide a theoretically informed and empirically reliable reconstruction of an argumentative text or discussion. As such, the method developed in this paper is especially suitable as a point of departure for developing instruments for computer-assisted argumentation analysis.},

The over-arching narrative is one of transition from paternalism and technocratic planning to market disciplines and a discourse of choice, and of the ceding of professional autonomy by clinicians to managers and to the state. These issues are discussed in a chronological survey of policy-making from Bevan's `creation' to the Blair era. Later sections consider evaluations of the service, starting with Webster's thesis that the NHS has been subject to prolonged under-funding, particularly under Conservative stewardship, then moving to assessments of the Thatcher, Major and Blair reforms. Much of the historical literature on the NHS is contentious and opinions are sharply divided on the reform era since the 1970s and the trajectories this has set for the future.},

  abstract = {Over the past 25 years, J\"urgen Habermas has presented what is arguably the most coherent and wide-ranging defence of the project of European unification and of parallel developments towards a politically integrated world society. In developing his key concepts of the transnationalisation of democracy and the constitutionalisation of international law, Habermas offers the main players in the struggles over the fate of the European Union (the politicians, the political parties and the publics of the member states) a way out of the current economic and political crisis, should they choose to follow it. In the title essay Habermas addresses the challenges and threats posed by the current banking and public debt crisis in the Eurozone for European unification. He is harshly critical of the incrementalist, technocratic policies advocated by the German government in particular, which are being imposed at the expense of the populations of the economically weaker, crisis-stricken countries and are undermining solidarity between the member states. He argues that only if the technocratic approach is replaced by a deeper democratization of the European institutions can the European Union fulfil its promise as a model for how rampant market capitalism can once again be brought under political control at the supranational level. This volume reflects the impressive scope of Habermas's recent writings on European themes, including theoretical treatments of the complex legal and political issues at stake, interventions on current affairs, and reflections on the lives and works of major European philosophers and intellectuals. Together the essays provide eloquent testimony to the enduring relevance of the work of one of the most influential and far-sighted public intellectuals in the world today, and are essential reading for all philosophers, legal scholars and social scientists interested in European and global issues.},

  abstract = {Francis Bacon, long considered a minor figure in the founding of modern political thought, is now recognized as one of its foremost thinkers. Bacon not only championed a new type and method of scientific inquiry, he also developed a plan for how modern society could be re-ordered to accommodate and promote scientific progress. Bacon's scientific writings cannot be wholly understood apart from his political writings, and many of his works combine the two topics so subtly that it is difficult to even place them in a definitive category; in this book, Kimberly Hurd Hale identifies the thread in Bacon's body of work that links modern science and liberalism. Hale provides a detailed analysis of New Atlantis, examining Bacon's place in the founding of modern political philosophy and the ways he relates to Plato, Machiavelli, and Hobbes. Hurd argues that Bacon's demonstration of scientific rule in the New Atlantis is not meant as a blueprint for modern society; rather it shows us the dangers of a scientific society devoid of liberty. By examining what is troubling about the New Atlantis, this book explains what problems lead to the emergence of Atlantean societies, i.e. societies that are prosperous, ambitious, and doomed. It shows that Bacon's portrait of Bensalem may provide the light necessary to guide those of us living in a world shaped by modern science through the dangerous seas.},

When defining a classification approach that combines general-language and domain-specific word embeddings, we go beyond previous work and align vector spaces to gain comparative embeddings. We suggest two novel models to exploit general- vs. domain-specific comparisons: a simple neural network model with pre-computed comparative-embedding information as input, and a multi-channel model computing the comparison internally. Both models outperform previous approaches, with the multi-channel model performing best.},

These issues come to the fore in the light of the intensive deployment of particular rhetorics of globalization and European integration within policy-making, journalistic and corporate communities. This paper seeks to contribute to the development of an institutionalist and yet social constructivist understanding of the appeal to external economic constraints (such as globalization and European integration) within contemporary European public policy and political economy. Through an attempt rst to map the range of discourses of globalization and European integration in contemporary Europe and then to chart the (frequently) strategic deployment of such discourses in Britain, France, Germany and Italy, the paper attempts to move beyond an understanding of globalization discourse as the linguistic expression of exogenous interests. It shows how ideational structures become institutionalized and normalized, thereby coming to delimit conceptions of `the possible' among political actors.},

  abstract = {The winter of discontent continues to exert a powerful hold over the British political imaginary. It acts as a discursive key to a collective mythology seemingly appealed to, and conjured, in each wave of industrial unrest, in each hint of political turmoil and, until recently, whenever the election of a Labour Government looked credible. In this paper I consider the rhetorical strategies and linguistic devices deployed by the tabloid media in the narration of the events of the winter of 1978-79. I argue for an interpretation of the winter of discontent as a moment of state crisis. By crisis however I do not refer to the mere accumulation of contradictions but rather to a moment of transition, a moment of decisive intervention. Within such a framework, the winter of discontent emerges as a strategic moment in the transformation of the British state, and perhaps the key moment in the pre-history of Thatcherism. For, as I hope to demonstrate, the initial appeal of the New Right was premised upon its ability to offer a convincing construction of the winter of discontent as symptomatic of a more fundamental crisis of the state. In such a moment of crisis, a particular type of decisive intervention was called for. In this discursive construction of crisis the New Right proved itself capable of changing, if not the hearts and minds of the electorate, then certainly the predominant perceptions of the political context. It recruited subjects to its vision of the necessary response to the crisis of a monolithic state besieged by the trade unions. This was perhaps the only truly hegemonic moment of Thatcherism. It occurred well before Mrs Thatcher entered Number 10. It is thus not surprising that one of the most enduring and distinctive legacies of Thatcherism has been the new political lexicon of crisis, siege and subterfuge born of the winter of discontent.},

  author = {Hay, Colin},
  pages = {29},
  abstract = {The political economy of Britain over the past three decades provides an interesting example of the consolidation, normalization and institutionalization of a new economic paradigm \'A/ neoliberalism. As such, it serves as a potentially instructive focus for debate both about the conditions under which economic paradigms are replaced and consolidated and the evolution of such paradigms through the process of institutionalization. In this paper I suggest that the institutionalization of this new economic paradigm has been associated with the shift from a normative to a normalized and necessitarian neoliberalism. I examine the role played by rationalist assumptions in this extended process of normalization-institutionalization. After presenting a stylized account of the evolution of British neoliberalism, I show how New Labour's monetary policy regime is the heir to the legacy of monetarism and its agenda of labour-market reform is the heir to Thatcherism's supply-side economics. I suggest that the time-inconsistency thesis and the business school globalization thesis have played an equivalent role, for New Labour, to that played for the new right by monetarism and supply-side economics in legitimating neoliberalism. In this way neoliberalism has been normalized. In the final sections of the paper I reflect on the implications of the normalized and necessitarian character of neoliberalism in Britain for its contestability and for democratic economic governance more broadly.},

While results on perusing the gold RST annotations for predicting argumentation have been published (Peldszus and Stede, 2016b), the step to automatic discourse parsing has not yet been taken. In this paper, we run various discourse parsers (RST, PDTB) on the corpus, compare their results to the gold annotations (for RST) and then assess the contribution of automatically-derived discourse features for argumentation parsing. After reproducing the state-of-the-art Evidence Graph model from Afantenos et al. (2018) for the microtexts, we find that PDTB features can indeed improve its performance.}

Yet, there is little research on how attitudes towards technocracy may impact European citizens' political behaviour. Moreover, the consistency of technocracy supporters' political attitudes, especially towards the EU, is questionable. This paper uses new survey panel data collected before and after the European parliament elections in May 2019 in six countries (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain). We investigate how citizens' technocratic attitudes affect their voting behaviour in the European elections. We find evidence that citizens with technocratic attitudes are less likely to support mainstream parties, and tend to either abstain or, if they vote, to give their vote to anti-system parties, especially from the populist right. In addition, by distinguishing technocracy supporters according to their partisanship, we conclude that technocracy is a thin ideology that can be combined with different patterns of political support: while many technocracy supporters have no party identification or support non-mainstream parties and show dissatisfaction with democracy and the EU, another subgroup of technocracy supporters identifies with a mainstream political party and show above average political support and support for the EU.},

A second path, a "Lib-Lab" route, centers on strategic incorporation of labor parties and/or unions into governing Liberal coalitions. A possible third path involves reforms by Catholic parties governing patriarchal, unitary states confronting working-class challenges. The virtual absence of leftist governments before the Great Depression has challenged claims for major impacts of the working class on welfare-state formation through the 1920s. However, we find that mobilization of the working class was integral to each conjuncture that generated the adoption of social security programs during the 1880-1930 period. Worker mobilization combined with such varied and distinctly state institutions as patriarchal states and Liberal party governments in ways that advanced welfare states.},

Complementing the German lexicographical approach to conceptual history, the authors argue that parliamentary debates in several European countries provide more reliable sources for the past use of the language of politics. T h e y emphasize the possibilities for the study of political history and the rhetoric of parliamentary institutions offered by the use of parliamentary debates side by side with the study of archival sources and published literature. Rhetorical studies and historical analyses of the use of key concepts emphasize speaking as a major form of political action and the value of parliamentary debates independently of the results of the final votes. Parliamentary debates in themselves, as a part of the decision-making process and with their increasing links to extraparliamentary publicity, promoted change in political language and culture. T h e debates allow us to identify precisely the actual speaking situations in which the key political concepts were used. T h e y also show how the emerging codification of parliamentary procedure was registered in the contested parliamentary vocabulary and how parliamentary debate gradually superseded the ancient examples of deliberative rhetoric. Finally, the authors address the methodological challenges involved in the use of parliamentary sources for the study of a comparative conceptual history of politics. T h e examples provided focus on the British Parliament and the Swedish Diet, particularly in the eighteenth century.},

Amongst them are the concept of grounding and the speaker's deictic centre, iconographic reference, frames, cultural cognitive models as a subgroup of Idealized Cognitive Models, conceptual metaphors, root metaphors, frames as groups of metaphors, mental spaces, and conceptual blending.The first section 'Political metaphor and ideology' discusses topics such as Nazi Germany, discrimination of Afro-Americans, South Africa's "rainbow nation," and the impeachment campaign against President Clinton. The second section, on cross-cultural "Otherness" deals with cultural clashes such as those between the Basque symbolic world and the general European value systems; between the Islam and the West, determining its treatment of Iraq in the Gulf War; and between Hong Kong "Otherness" and centuries of Western dominance. The third section deals with 'Metaphors for institutional ideologies' and concentrates on the globalisation of the North and South American markets, on insults in (un)parliamentary debates, and on the Internet being for sale.},

While the first four chapters develop the linguistic and conceptual aspects of argument expression, the last four are devoted to their application to argument mining. These chapters investigate the facets of argument annotation, as well as argument mining system architectures and evaluation. How annotations may be used to develop linguistic data and how to train learning algorithms is outlined. A simple implementation is then proposed. The book ends with an analysis of non-verbal argumentative discourse. Argument Mining is an introductory book for engineers or students of linguistics, artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Most, if not all, the concepts of argumentation crucial for argument mining are carefully introduced and illustrated in a simple manner.},

At its heart are the dramatic and violent events associated with the French Revolution of 1789 and the birth of the First Republic in 1792. For the next two centuries, writers in France struggled to make sense of these and subsequent events in French revolutionary history, producing a rich and perceptive analysis of the nature of republican government. But, as Revolution and the Republic shows, these important debates were not limited to the narrow confines of politics and to the writing of constitutions. Such was their significance that they occupied a central place in discussions about religion, science, philosophy, commerce, and the writing of history. They also shaped arguments about the character of France and the French nation as well as polemics about the role of intellectuals in French society. Moreover, they continue to be of importance in France today as the country faces the challenges posed by globalisation, multiculturalism, and the reform of the welfare state. Integrating the perspectives of intellectual history, political theory, social and cultural history, and political economy, Jeremy Jennings has written a study of political ideas that appeals to all those interested in the history of modern France and Europe more generally.},

Yet even then a positive view of science remained largely intact. Even after World War II, the Shoah, saturation bombings of civilians, and the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the industrialization of science proceeded at an ever faster pace, assisted by an increasing involvement of state power. The United States science adviser Vannevar Bush (1945) went so far as to present post-World War II science as an ``endless frontier'' and font of social benefits in healthcare, economic development, and military defense.},

Channeled by their long-term `chief', Howard Scott, their claim was that technology always provides the most effective solution to modern social, cultural and political problems. The account focuses on the expression of this technological faith, and how it was proselytized, from the era of high industrialism between the World Wars through, and beyond, the nuclear age. I argue that the packaging and promotion of these ideas relied on allegorical technological tales and readily-absorbed graphic imagery. Combined with what Scott called `symbolization', this seductive discourse preached beliefs about technology to broad audiences. The style and conviction of the messages were echoed by establishment figures such as National Lab director Alvin Weinberg, who employed the techniques to convert mainstream and elite audiences through the end of the twentieth century.},

Third Way politicians effectively legitimated their ideas of an `activating social welfare state' by creating and supporting networks of scholars, committees and institutions which prepared reform.

The cartel party thesis holds that political parties increasingly function like cartels, employing the resources of the state to limit political competition and ensure their own electoral success. The thesis has been subject to varied empirical testing and to substantial theoretical evaluation and criticism. Against this background, we look again at the cartel party thesis in order to clarify ambiguities in and misinterpretations of the original argument. We also suggest further refinements, specifications and extensions of the argument. Following a background review of the original thesis, we break it down into its core components, and then clarify the terms in which it makes sense to speak of cartelization and collusion. We then go on to explore some of the implications of the thesis for our understanding of contemporary democracies and patterns of party organization and party competition and we identify a possible agenda for future research in party scholarship.},

In mapping out a strategically important change in the political ideology and s\&\#39;ocial psychology of contemporary capitalism in America and Europe, the authors raise essential questions about whether such a \&quot;new capitalism\&quot; will favor or diminish the international competitiveness of the economies in which it has come to the fore. This stimulating and wide-ranging volume at the cutting edge of analysis will be of interest to sociologists, economists, and organizational analysts.},

War and Welfare examines the legacy of the 'warfare state' and reveals how it paved the path for the welfare state in ensuing decades. Jytte Klausen shows how the institutional marks made by World War II were critical to capitalist reform after the war. She argues that the warfare state was a gift to the European Left, and asserts that state-expansion and the changing domestic order during the war, in most countries regardless of their stances, anticipated the welfare state. When the war ended in 1945, the reconstruction process rested on piecemeal decisions to remove or retain war-time controls over the economy, ranging from state cartels to wage fixing. Klausen argues that the welfare state ratified prior changes in state-society relations and represented a continuation of institutional development undertaken during the war years. Meticulously researched and cogently argued, War and Welfare offers a different angle on the conception and construction of the welfare state, and lends insights into what may lie ahead in the future.},

Most importantly, there is a lack of concepts for a comparative assessment of bureaucratic influence across different International Organizations. This article addresses this shortcoming by offering a conceptualization of administrative styles. Depending on dominant strategic orientations shaping administrative routines, we identify four ideal types: a servant style, an advocacy style, a consolidator style, and an entrepreneurial style. We argue that the variation in administrative styles across different organizations can be explained by two factors, namely the internal and external challenges they face. The concept and theoretical explanation are illustrated in four case studies on the bureaucracies of the International Monetary Fund, the Bank for International Settlements, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Labor Organization.},

While this assumption has a lot to it, it opens up new questions. The many studies on experts in their different capacities and historical settings have, so far, rarely added up to a historical narrative of experts in a more comprehensive way (as existing in sociological studies, e.g.). Focusing on European examples from the period the period 1850 to the 1960s my paper will try to make some suggestions about more general aspects such a history could focus on (while in no way attempting to deliver a worked-out narrative itself). In doing so in particular the question of how to integrate Europe's `Age of Extremes' into the historical narrative of experts will be addressed.},

It is also necessary to consider the institutionalization of Taylorism, as failure to do so leads to an unrecognized paradox. Taylorism is analysed here in terms of the division of labour, the structure of control over task performance, and the implicit minimum interaction employment relationship. Taylorism represents an organizational form without any notion of a career-structure, unlike other organizational models available at the turn of the century. Therefore, Taylorism can be defined as the bureaucratization of the structure of control, but not the employment relationship. In industrial organizations calculability requires processes of determining and fixing effort levels. Taylorism represents the historical switchover to the creation of new social mechanisms for constituting effort standards within an accelerated dynamic of deskilling. It is this, not incentive wages, which is the crucial element in Taylorism in relation to wage/effort exchange. Historically Taylorism was not the rabid destroyer of the craft system. It replaced, over time, systems of internal contract, which were indirect forms of employment and control. The notion of direct employment underlies both Taylorism and the bureaucratic model.},

  abstract = {Over the past 25 years, J\"urgen Habermas has presented what is arguably the most coherent and wide-ranging defence of the project of European unification and of parallel developments towards a politically integrated world society. In developing his key concepts of the transnationalisation of democracy and the constitutionalisation of international law, Habermas offers the main players in the struggles over the fate of the European Union (the politicians, the political parties and the publics of the member states) a way out of the current economic and political crisis, should they choose to follow it. In the title essay Habermas addresses the challenges and threats posed by the current banking and public debt crisis in the Eurozone for European unification. He is harshly critical of the incrementalist, technocratic policies advocated by the German government in particular, which are being imposed at the expense of the populations of the economically weaker, crisis-stricken countries and are undermining solidarity between the member states. He argues that only if the technocratic approach is replaced by a deeper democratization of the European institutions can the European Union fulfil its promise as a model for how rampant market capitalism can once again be brought under political control at the supranational level. This volume reflects the impressive scope of Habermas?s recent writings on European themes, including theoretical treatments of the complex legal and political issues at stake, interventions on current affairs, and reflections on the lives and works of major European philosophers and intellectuals. Together the essays provide eloquent testimony to the enduring relevance of the work of one of the most influential and far-sighted public intellectuals in the world today, and are essential reading for all philosophers, legal scholars and social scientists interested in European and global issues.},

Does this sym\- pathy imply a logical congruence? Comparing theories of militant democracy and epistemic technocracy (aka epistocracy), I discover a common approach to basic aspects of representative democracy. Both theories see voters as fallible or ignorant instead of capable political agents; and they both understand political parties to be channels of state rule rather than democratic expression. This shared suspicion of grassroots political agency explains why they employ nondemocratic means to pursue their goals. But the two theories appear to be also analytically co-extensive. Like militant democrats, epistemic technocrats polem\- icize antidemocrats inasmuch as the latter are proxies for epistemically foul decision-making. Conversely, militant democrats try to block `incorrect' deci\- sions as long as these lead to democratic subversion, thereby producing a distinct type of militant technocracy. The article ends by drawing the implica\- tions of this symbiosis of epistemic and militant democratic ideas for contem\- porary democratic theory.},

Yet the history it unfolds is primarily the story of individuals: thinkers and dreamers who envisaged an ideal social order and described it persuasively, leaving a mark on their own and later times.  The roster of utopians includes men of all stripes in different countries and eras--figures as disparate as More and Fourier, the Marquis de Sade and Edward Bellamy, Rousseau and Marx. Fascinating character studies of the major figures are among the delights of the book.  Utopian writings run the gamut from fictional narratives to theoretical treatises, from political manifestos to constitutions for a new society. The Manuels have structured five centuries of utopian invention by identifying successive constellations, groups of thinkers joined by common social and moral concerns. Within this framework they analyze individual writings, in the context of the author's life and of the socio-economic, religious, and political exigencies of his time. Concentrating on innovative works, they highlight disjunctures as well as continuities in utopian thought from the Renaissance through the twentieth century.  Witty and erudite, challenging in its interpretations and provocative in the questions it poses, the Manuels' anatomy of utopia is an adventure in ideas.},

Deeply conservative and elitist in his political views, Bacon adapted Tudor strategies of State management and bureaucracy, the social anxieties and prejudices of the late Elizabethan governing elite, and a principal intellectual resource of the English governing classes - the Common Law - into a novel vision and method for the sciences.

  address = {{United States -- Maryland}},
  abstract = {Between 1945 and 2005, the United Kingdom underwent two deep-seated institutional transformations\textemdash roughly starting around 1945 and 1979 respectively\textemdash when all received wisdom on how to govern the economy was called into question and the basic terms of the political debate were changed. Attlee and Thatcher emerge as the great "innovators" who were able to effectively implement most of their political platforms. During those two time intervals (1945-1979 and 1979-2005), there were also two opportunities to challenge the prevailing institutional arrangements. Heath won the general election in 1970 promising a radical overhaul of Britain's institutions, only to fail in 1972, when he was forced to take a U-turn; and Blair's "New Labour," winning a larger majority in 1997 than Labour in 1945, did not accomplish a major break with the Thatcherite settlement but ended up strengthening it instead. The dissertation attempts to answer this puzzle by considering the impact of economic crisis on bringing about policy change, through an intertemporal and qualitative comparison of four case studies: 1945-51 (Attlee), 1970-74 (Heath), 1979-90 (Thatcher), and 1997-05 (Blair). The central argument of the dissertation is that the key to continuity and change in economic policymaking is the role that available ideas play during periods of sharp economic downturns in defining the various options of government policy. When economic turmoil is perceived both by the general electorate and constructed by the political establishment as a real "crisis," then new ideas will matter if they offer an explanation of what went wrong, and how it call be fixed, and subsequently can function as a roadmap for an emerging new institutional structure. If there is, however, no real perception of crisis, then there will be little incentive for radical transformations, and institutional change will at most be incremental. In the latter case, new ideas will play a marginal role and will only be implemented insofar as they 'fit' into the existing settlement, leading to a path dependent future institutional development. Instead of changing the status quo, these changes will end up strengthening the current institutions by eliminating their minor weaknesses, making future reform more difficult.},

Degree: Ph.D.DegreeYear: 1995Institute: The University of ChicagoOver the last decade there has been a veritable explosion of Anglo-American interest in the works of Weimar constitutional and political theorist, Carl Schmitt. There has been concurrently a revival in the treatment of technology as a subject worthy of social-philosophical inquiry. Yet the two scholarly movements have surprisingly passed each other by. Surprisingly because as I demonstrate the German critique of technology is crucial for understanding the works of Schmitt, especially his criticisms of liberalism, and vice versa, theoretical confrontations with technology, often dismissed as excessively abstract, could benefit greatly by observing the way in which Schmitt incorporated theoretical engagements with technology into practical-political treatises. The conjuncture of the critiques of liberalism and technology in Schmitt''s writings may shed fresh light on the perennial problem of "technocracy" in liberal democracies and the potential for authoritarianism latent within it. The context in which fascism first emerged in Europe was characterized by a structural transformation--a fusion--of the economy, society and politics as welfare state conditions eclipsed the nineteenth century''s--supposedly separate--state/society configuration. As the perceived agent of this transformation technology consequently aroused exhilaration, awe and fear irrespective of whether it was perceived as beneficial or detrimental. The analyses on the part of the intellectuals who engaged technology in this context were sometimes hysterical but also sometimes quite perspicacious. Soviet Communism, fascism and liberal technocracy were all posed as solutions to this situation. Since the 1970s industrial societies have undergone another structural transformation as a Fordist welfare state configuration gives way to a globalized one. This process has brought down Soviet Communism, but fascism has reemerged and liberal technocracy transmutes itself in not necessarily progressive ways. The considerations on these political alternatives in the wake of this century''s first technological transformation by fascism''s most brilliant promoter and liberalism''s most relentless critic may not provide facile answers in the midst of this century''s second transformation. But we must properly understand the past to accurately assess the present and insure that the disastrous outcome that befell a fragile liberal democracy such as Weimar''s does not occur again. function show\_abstract() \{   \$('\#abstract1').hide();   \$('\#abstract2').show();   \$('\#abstract\_expand').hide(); \} \ding{116}\cyrchar\CYRP\cyrchar\cyro\cyrchar\cyrk\cyrchar\cyra\cyrchar\cyrz\cyrchar\cyra\cyrchar\cyrt\cyrchar\cyrsftsn{} \cyrchar\cyrp\cyrchar\cyro\cyrchar\cyrl\cyrchar\cyrn\cyrchar\cyro\cyrchar\cyrs\cyrchar\cyrt\cyrchar\cyrsftsn\cyrchar\cyryu},

The article seeks to evaluate differential responses of Labour's `right-wing' and revisionist tendency as its loosely cohesive framework of Keynesian social democracy imploded in the 1970s, as a means of demonstrating its relative incoherence and fragmentation. The `crisis of social democracy' revealed much more starkly its complex, heterogeneous character, irremediably `divided within itself' over a range of critical political and policy themes and the basis of social democratic political philosophy itself. The article argues that it was its own wider political fragmentation and ideological introspection in the face of the `crisis' of its historic `belief system' which led to the fracture of Labour's `dominant coalition' and the rupture of British social democracy.},

This review provides a close study of Brittan's 'The economic contradictions of democracy' (1975, hereafter ECD)-one of the most cited contr\`ibutions to the declinist literature of the decade-in which Brittan warned that, without remedial action, liberal democracy 'is likely to pass away within the lifetime of people now adult'. In this reappraisal of Brittan's ECD, it is argued that this paper is much more than just eloquent, scholarly declinism, and in the process, the generic problem facing all contemporary historians of thought and policy is confronted: what is the influence of any one individual and/or work? The reappraisal relates directly to central themes of the 1970s 'crisis', especially 'overhad' and 'ungovernability'; it examines the competitive nature of the market for declinist prognostications (notably the Jay\textemdash Brittan nexus), with one objective being to provide a counterbalance to much recent scholarship which has over-focused on think-tanks at the expense of elite journalists who were very far from being academics manques; and, finally, it reviews Brittan's role in the so-called Thatcher revolution, where much has been claimed but little documented.},

The Power Elite can be read as a good account of what was taking place in America at the time it was written, but its underlying question of whether America is as democratic in practice as it is in theory continues to matter very much today.What The Power Elite informed readers of in 1956 was how much the organization of power in America had changed during their lifetimes, and Alan Wolfe's astute afterword to this new edition brings us up to date, illustrating how much more has changed since then. Wolfe sorts out what is helpful in Mills' book and which of his predictions have not come to bear, laying out the radical changes in American capitalism, from intense global competition and the collapse of communism to rapid technological transformations and ever changing consumer tastes. The Power Elite has stimulated generations of readers to think about the kind of society they have and the kind of society they might want, and deserves to be read by every new generation.},

His original diagnosis in his famous paper of 1975 was deeply pessimistic in character, but subsequent adaptations by government solved many of the original problems arising from dependency relations. These adaptations amounted to the creation of a Madisonian system of regulation that insulated policy makers from democratic pressures. But these adaptations in turn created new difficulties that lie at the root of the analysis in King and Crewe's The Blunders of our Governments, published nearly four decades after King's original classic paper.},

This is a result of two major developments: Legislatures have become less reflective of popular opinion because of the growing role of money in politics. At the same time, they have also become less powerful because of the growing importance of bureaucratic agencies, central banks, judicial review, free trade, and international institutions. But there are no easy solutions, since some of these institutions are needed to meet high expectations on government performance. The ``technocratic dilemma'' thus poses a real threat to liberal democracy's ability to meet the public's twin demands of responsiveness and performance.},

Economic growth did bound ahead, far outstripping pre-war performance and reaching a climacteric of over 3 per cent a year in the late 1960s and early 1970s.2 Total economic output rose by 83 per cent between 1951 and 1973, while real personal disposal incomes rose by 77 per cent and consumer expenditure by 79 per cent.3 Consumer goods of all types filled British homes. The figure for households containing televisions leapt from 35 per cent to 96 per cent between 1955 and 1975, and the figure for telephones rose from 19 to 52 per cent.4 Governments constantly entreated British workers to greater efforts, but as the economist Clare Griffin noted as early as 1950, `the worker is told Britain is poor \ldots{} but the worker doesn't feel poor. He has more money than before and his job is more secure'.5 This book intends to examine this central paradox in British economic, social and political life.},

German, Scandinavian, Italian ? are also suggested. The article concludes with a brief sketch of the main reasons other Europeans? apparent ?success? came to seem so important.

We deploy a Most Similar Systems comparison of Denmark and Sweden and include survey answers from 657 civil servants in managerial positions. We find that political recruitment of top civil servants, such as Swedish state secretaries, restricts the access of the civil service to the minister, but it does not substantially politicize the policy process. Danish civil servants perceive themselves as more contested by the relatively few Danish political advisers than their Swedish colleagues. Our results imply that the organization of political advice is a crucial factor for politicization and contestability},

They helped to bridge political gaps of class and religion by building compromise and consensus. But advisory committees and councils have also been described as somewhat shady and essentially closed institutions, forming an iron ring around the departments that hampered necessary policy changes. In this article, based on case studies on the selection of members of committees and a survey of all members of committees advising the central government, we will explore to what extent committees can still be described as bastions of conservatism. We will briefly describe selection processes, sketch a portrait of committee members and compare some characteristics of committee members and civil servants of individual ministries.},

  abstract = {Scientism, or the application of methods, attitudes, and concepts drawn from the natural sciences to human activities and social policy formation, is a pervasive feature of modern life, and it is one which has immense impact upon virtually all aspects of our private and public lives. This work explores the impact of Scientific Management, a movement initiated at the beginning of the twentieth century by the mechanical engineer, Frederick Winslow Taylor, in spreading scientistic attitudes through its appropriation by technical experts (technocrats) who have played a central and growing role in formulating public policies, not just in the United States, but throughout the world. It explores the movement of Scientific Management out of its initial American industrial context into progressive politics in the United States, into the policies of the Third Reich, those of the Soviet Union under Lenin and Stalin, into Cold War policy formation in both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R , and into those of contemporary China and the European Union, with short but important excursions into France, Sweden, Japan, and the developing world. Moreover it also explores some of the aesthetic dimensions of scientism and technocracy, especially as they have been reflected in modernist architecture and literature, and it examines current trends in education and the structure of advisory organizations such as RAND Corporation which are shaping the character and impact of scientistic and technocratic attitudes. Overall the approach is ambivalent toward scientism, acknowledging some of its great strengths in promoting economic growth and providing advice on security related issues, but offering criticisms of its narrow emphasis on efficiency, its insensitivity to qualitative considerations and the experience of those with specialized local knowledge, and its long term tendency to ignore distributive justice and promote income concentration.},

Institutionalist scholars such as Peter Hall, Mark Blyth, Vivien Schmidt and Colin Hay have focused particularly on the 1980s. The polarizing ascension of Thatcher and Reagan, characterized by a public battle of ideas, has become the prime example of a broader neoliberal turn. Based on this experience, it is common to assume that a shift in policy paradigm involves a politicized contest over ideas. The Dutch market-oriented reforms of the 1980s have long been described as a counterexample, representing an alternative, consensual trajectory of institutional change. As critics have pointed out, the problem with this account is that there is little evidence for an economic policy consensus in the 1980s. Based on the Dutch case, this paper proposes a third, depoliticized model of institutional change, where policy makers instigate a battle of ideas within the institutions, while politicians depoliticize the reforms in public debate.},

The formation of a distinct parliamentary vocabulary helps us to distinguish parliaments from other assemblies. Neither conceptual nor parliamentary histories, however, have directed any attention to the concepts by which parliaments operate for conducting and regulating their deliberations, using ordinary language concepts but giving them a specific parliamentary meaning. The procedural tracts for Westminster from the late sixteenth to the early twentieth century provide strategic sources for the politics and history of intra-parliamentary concepts. In this article, four types of parliamentary concepts of action and debate are distinguished, namely those referring to parliamentary moves, to parliamentary order, to parliamentary time and to parliamentary agenda. They refer to different aspects of parliamentary debates; they have different histories in terms of intentional or tacit conceptual changes, and explicit disputes around the concepts. In terms of classical rhetoric, moves refer to elocution, their regulation by order and time to two forms of disposition, and the agenda to the invention. The opposition between `parliamentary' and `unparliamentary' uses of concepts can be understood in the sense of Reinhart Koselleck's distinction between symmetric and asymmetric use of political concepts.},

Parliamentary acting and thinking offer us the best example of politics as a contingent and controversial activity. Using a parliamentary imagination, the author constructs the ideal type in five main chapters: dissensual modes of proceeding; rhetoric of parliamentary debate; parliamentary formation and control of government; parliamentarians as politicians; and parliamentary time as their common subtext. In the last two chapters, the book outlines the possibilities of extending parliamentary judgment to politics beyond parliaments proper and the chances for parliamentary politics succeeding today.},

  abstract = {The Politics of Dissensus inverts the traditional perspective on the study of parliamentary politics by focusing on its less obvious and less well-known aspects. Dissensus instead of consensus becomes the condition for the intelligibility of parliamentary politics. Such politics is indebted to the rhetorical culture of addressing issues from opposite perspectives and debating the alternatives pro et contra: no motion is approved without a thorough examination of, and confrontation among, imaginable alternatives. Establishing the openness of political debating, parliamentarism has become a distinctive historical contribution to the rise of parliamentary democracy. Parliament in Debate refers to the paradigmatic institution for political deliberation, the debates surrounding its legislative activity, as well as the supervision of government and administration. Parliament has become a fascinating object of scrutiny as a political institution adopted and developed by different political traditions. In a nutshell, the book retrieves the study of parliamentary politics to present political theory and action in the parliamentary mode. It is a book on the relevance of parliamentarism to the study of politics and a book on the comparative conceptual and institutional history of parliamentary politics. The Politics of Dissensus: Parliament in Debate is the outcome of an international team of contributors coordinated by two ongoing research projects, relying on a long-lasting international cooperation, namely the Academy of Finland project The Politics of Dissensus and the Spanish National Research Fund projects The Rhetorics of Democracy and The Civic Constellation.},

These translations, however, may inappropriately harborsome of our contemporary assumptions about the relation between theory(the domain of `knowledge') and practice (the concern of`craft' or `art'). In our era, the paradigm oftheory is pure mathematics, that has no obvious application topractical problems of, e.g., engineering. As well, theoretical physicssometimes has a tenuous relation to confirming/disconfirmingexperimentation. At the other end of the spectrum is craft, forexample, carpentry, which is so enmeshed in material application thatit resists any general explanation but must be learned by practice. Asa consequence, theory and practice even seem irreconcilable. Outsideof modern science, there is sometimes skepticism about the relevanceof theory to practice because it is thought that theory is conductedat so great a remove from the facts, the province of practice, that itcan lose touch with them. Indeed, at the level of practice, concreteexperience might be all we need.

These translations, however, may inappropriately harborsome of our contemporary assumptions about the relation between theory(the domain of `knowledge') and practice (the concern of`craft' or `art'). In our era, the paradigm oftheory is pure mathematics, that has no obvious application topractical problems of, e.g., engineering. As well, theoretical physicssometimes has a tenuous relation to confirming/disconfirmingexperimentation. At the other end of the spectrum is craft, forexample, carpentry, which is so enmeshed in material application thatit resists any general explanation but must be learned by practice. Asa consequence, theory and practice even seem irreconcilable. Outsideof modern science, there is sometimes skepticism about the relevanceof theory to practice because it is thought that theory is conductedat so great a remove from the facts, the province of practice, that itcan lose touch with them. Indeed, at the level of practice, concreteexperience might be all we need.

  abstract = {As innovation is increasingly becoming an imperative for policymakers around the globe, there is a growing tendency to frame policy problems as problems of innovation. This logic suggests that we are unable to address grand societal challenges and ensure economic competitiveness because our societies, institutions, scientific activities or individual predispositions are not sufficiently geared towards innovation. In this paper, we analyze this ``deficit model'' of innovation in which a lack of innovation is routinely invoked as the main obstacle to social progress. Drawing parallels to research on the deficit model of public understanding of science (PUS), we develop a theoretical framework that captures the dynamics and normative implications of deficit construction, highlighting five salient dimensions: problem diagnoses, proposed remedies, the role of expertise, implied social orders, and measures of success. We apply this framework to three empirical case studies of recent innovation strategies in Luxembourg, Singapore, and Denmark. Attention to this deficit framing around innovation is important, we argue, because it is an essential part of how innovation transforms societies in the 21st century: not only through new technological possibilities or economic growth, but also by shaping public discourse, narrowing policy options, and legitimizing major institutional interventions. The implied pro-innovation bias tends to marginalize other rationales, values, and social functions that do not explicitly support innovation. It further delegates decisions about sweeping social reconfigurations to innovation experts, which raises questions of accountability and democratic governance. Experiences from the history of PUS suggest that, without a dedicated effort to transform innovation policy into a more democratic, inclusive, and explicitly political field, the present deficit logic and its technocratic overtones risks significant social and political conflict.},

  abstract = {Each of our theories of mental representation provides some insight into how the mind works. However, these insights often seem incompatible, as the debates between symbolic, dynamical, emergentist, sub-symbolic, and grounded approaches to cognition attest. Mental representations\textemdash whatever they are\textemdash must share many features with each of our theories of representation, and yet there are few hypotheses about how a synthesis could be possible. Here, I develop a theory of the underpinnings of symbolic cognition that shows how sub-symbolic dynamics may give rise to higher-level cognitive representations of structures, systems of knowledge, and algorithmic processes. This theory implements a version of conceptual role semantics by positing an internal universal representation language in which learners may create mental models to capture dynamics they observe in the world. The theory formalizes one account of how truly novel conceptual content may arise, allowing us to explain how even elementary logical and computational operations may be learned from a more primitive basis. I provide an implementation that learns to represent a variety of structures, including logic, number, kinship trees, regular languages, context-free languages, domains of theories like magnetism, dominance hierarchies, list structures, quantification, and computational primitives like repetition, reversal, and recursion. This account is based on simple discrete dynamical processes that could be implemented in a variety of different physical or biological systems. In particular, I describe how the required dynamics can be directly implemented in a connectionist framework. The resulting theory provides an ``assembly language'' for cognition, where high-level theories of symbolic computation can be implemented in simple dynamics that themselves could be encoded in biologically plausible systems.},

Their attitude was not only the product of a specific context. It was rooted in a long tradition of connection between French engineering and social preoccupations. This connection emerged at the time of the creation of the first corps of State engineers in the 17th and 18th centuries. Indeed, State Weber engineers were from the start convinced that they had a social mission. Subsequent episodes, like the Saint-Simonian reflections on the eve of industrialization, or the discussions held in the think tank X-Crise in the aftermath of the 1929 economic crisis contributed also to shape the engineers' sensitivity to social issues. Dwelling on these episodes, but also trying to go beyond their standard assessment, we would like to propose here a more general interpretation of the complex set of relations between French engineering and social thought. In this perspective, the Post-World War II French engineers' technocratic concerns come at the end of a long and complex evolution. This case study should enable a better understanding of the more general connivance between engineering culture and technocratic ideals.},

The authors apply a comparative approach to analyzing debates in the primary sources in a number of countries and languages and situate the results into a broader European context. Focusing on European democratization from different historical and analytical perspectives, they discuss the politics, concepts and histories involved in democratization as a complex of changes that has altered the conditions of political action and debate in the continent for the past two centuries.},

  abstract = {"Why did such highly abstract ideas as truth, knowledge, or justice become so important to us? What was the point of coming to think in these terms? In The Practical Origins of Ideas, Matthieu Queloz presents a philosophical method designed to answer such questions: the method of pragmatic genealogy. Pragmatic genealogies are partly fictional, partly historical narratives exploring what might have driven us to develop certain ideas in order to discover what these do for us. The book uncovers an under-appreciated tradition of pragmatic genealogy which cuts across the analytic--continental divide, running from the state-of-nature stories of David Hume and the early genealogies of Friedrich Nietzsche to recent work in analytic philosophy by Edward Craig, Bernard Williams, and Miranda Fricker. However, these genealogies combine fictionalizing and historicizing in ways that even philosophers sympathetic to the use of state-of-nature fictions or real history have found puzzling. To make sense of why both fictionalizing and historicizing are called for, the book offers a systematic account of pragmatic genealogies as dynamic models serving to reverse-engineer the points of ideas in relation not only to near-universal human needs, but also to socio-historically situated needs.

Such influences included the 1927 Trade Union Act, the Cheltenham agreement (1927) with the Co-operative Party and the appearance of the Liberal counter-cyclical economics proposals. The article argues that Labour's perceived base was wider than expected. Women and the rural classes, including farmers, were emphasized as target groups. Labour thought the key to a majority lay in the countryside. An investigation of the results from 1929 seems to imply this was not strictly the case, but there was a number of such constituencies which Labour was close to gaining. The Liberal revival helped Labour in the rural areas. Central planning was a light touch in 1929. It did, however, involve setting the framework for the campaign and making policy on all of the matters referred to above.},

  abstract = {The terms `technocracy' and `technocrat' are becoming part of common usage and it is frequently argued that technocratic decision-making is increasing due to the growing complexity of political matters. However, there is a lack of research into this matter and the concept is underdeveloped. The thesis departs from a more subtle interpretation of technocracy suggesting that technocracy is not equal to government by (technically trained) experts. The crucial issue for the definition of technocracy then is not who governs, rather it lies in the mode of politics. With this as a point of departure the overall aim of this thesis is to challenge the largely unproven assumption that technocrats can be defined by personal attributes (as educational background), as well as the traditional and commonly used measurements to identify technocratic thinking, arguing that that they are likely to produce a too simplistic picture of reality. Departing from the literature on technocracy an analytical framework is developed for exploring the presence of a techno- cratic as well as a democratic mode of reasoning and justification that allows for detecting possible nuances. Further, in order to understand variations in the mode of reasoning and justification I throughout the thesis suggest we need to consider the possible importance of different institutional contexts. Overall the thesis wishes to contribute to the old, but with continued centrality, discussion on the tension between technocracy and democracy. Resting on the claim that the degree of technocratic reasoning and justification among policy makers is one powerful determinant of the extent to which technocracy can be made compatible with (representative) democracy, I direct the search light towards two actors at the heart of policy-making \textendash{} top civil servants and politicians. The thesis consists of two parts The introduction to the thesis and The Essays. There are three Essays. In Essay 1 I search for explanations to variation in technocratic thinking among bureaucrats. Contrary to previous findings, I argue that type of higher education is not a key determinant for explaining variations, instead I suggest, post-socialization, as politicisation, provides a better explanation. These suggestions are tested empirically by both re-analysing Putnam's data from the late 1970s and analysing data from a total survey of elite bureaucrats working in the Government Offices of Sweden. Essay 2 seeks to explore the importance of different decision criteria in the minds of technocratic bureaucrats. Departing from the developed framework a questionnaire using hypothetical scenarios, each containing a different policy proposition, is designed. For each of the five scenarios technocratic bureaucrats are asked to rate the importance of ten different decision making criteria, each representing a different element of the two modes of reasoning. In Essay 3 I investigate the use of knowledge in parliamentary debate in the Swedish parliament (Riksdagen) searching for explanations for when politicians are likely to use knowledge to underpin their policy positions. The study presents empirical findings based on the analysis of the contents of 142 parliamentary debates testing a number of different hypotheses. The thesis reports several interesting findings and identifies important gaps in the field. In relation to the overall aim of the thesis the most important findings are that we need to continue to make the question of who is a technocrat into an empirical one and not base our definition on a largely unproven assumption that technocrats can be defined by personal attributes as educational background. Further, the results in this thesis suggest that technocratic and democratic modes of reasoning are not to be viewed as opposing sides of the same single dimension. Therefore, in future studies we ought to use measurements that allow the respondents to express nuances. Finally, the findings of politicians' use of knowledge in the parliamentary debate jointly indicate that, despite the relatively favourable conditions for knowledge utilization in the Swedish case, the debate is not likely to be largely de-politicized.},

Contrary to previous findings, the article argues that type of higher education is not a key determinant of variations in technocratic mentality among elite bureaucrats; instead, post-socialization provides a better explanation.

These suggestions are tested empirically by both re-analysing Putnam?s data from the late 1970s and analysing data from a total survey of elite bureaucrats working in the Government Offices of Sweden. As well as demonstrating that the ?type of training hypothesis? is poorly supported, the empirical analysis demonstrates that the technocratic mentality of bureaucrats varies depending on ministerial affiliation. Furthermore, the level of politicisation is connected to the degree of technocratic mentality among the bureaucrats, though not exactly as hypothesized: more politicisation indeed leads to higher ?tolerance for politics? among bureaucrats but, counter intuitively, also makes bureaucrats more likely to advocate neutrality rather than political advocacy among civil servants.},

@misc{RiseTechnopopulists,
  title = {The Rise of the Technopopulists},
  abstract = {A few days before it was announced there would be a nationwide UK lockdown from late March, Sky News political editor Beth Rigby remarked on an unexpected shift in the Prime Minister's behaviour. Struck by the importance Boris Johnson was attaching to scientific advice, Rigby mused that a populist politician seemed to be taking a non-populist approach to the crisis. The embrace of science has persisted throughout the pandemic. As well as justifying government decisions in the language of scientific advice, the country's chief medical officers and scientific advisers \textendash{} from Chris Whitty and Jenny Harries to the ill-fated epidemiologist Neil Ferguson \textendash{} have been leading actors in the British coronavirus drama.  From the outset, arguments about rival scientific models dominated political discussion. The ``herd immunity'' approach was popular early on but lost out to the suppression strategy promoted by Ferguson at Imperial College London. With the exception of Johnson's chief aide, Dominic Cummings, Downing Street has come down hard on anyone breaching Covid-19 restrictions. Johnson's determination to follow the advice of his scientists has created an opportunity for the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to present himself as less risk-averse and more attuned to the dangers that the pandemic poses for Britain's economy.  Experienced observers of British politics are right to be confused. After becoming Prime Minister in July last year, Johnson reaffirmed his status as the country's leading populist. He attached ``the people'' as a prefix to almost every dimension of his premiership. After pitting ``the people against parliament'' in his general election campaign, he created ``a people's government''. Having packed the House of Commons with his own MPs, Johnson called it ``the people's parliament''. The March 2020 Budget was ``the people's Budget''. This confusion stems from our expectation that promises to do what ``the people'' want will clash with appeals to expertise and competence. We think of populism and technocracy as opposites, not as complements. There are good reasons to believe in this opposition. The conflict between technocracy and democracy takes us back to Plato, who argued that we should think of the polis or ideal city in the same way as we think of the individual household, the oikos. Running a household requires skills, techne, and we expect those with the skills to be in charge. Similarly, we should put the ``philosopher kings'' in charge of running the polis. Technocracy is therefore skill (techne) plus power (kratos). The industrial age recast the meaning of technocracy in a way that tied it more closely to the liberating potential of modern technology. In the 18th century, the French social theorist Henri de Saint-Simon first proposed power be taken away from politicians and given to engineers. This idea exists today among tech enthusiasts in Silicon Valley. Empowering experts seems to imply the demobilisation of ``the people''. The opposition between populism and technocracy also makes sense because it confirms those who put their faith in technocratic forms of decision-making. Johnson's critics often remark rather smugly that a former Have I Got News For You panellist was never going to be able to handle a global pandemic. The failures of Donald Trump, Johnson and Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro in tackling Covid-19 have led to a crescendo of voices decrying the policy failures of populists. By contrast, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel \textendash{} who has a doctorate in quantum chemistry \textendash{} is celebrated for her seriousness of purpose. Placing populism and technocracy in opposition like this is a way of attacking those voters who elected the populists in the first place. We cannot understand the contemporary political moment if we stick to this opposition between populism and technocracy. Political competition in advanced democratic states today is increasingly ordered around appeals to both ``the people'' and to competence and expertise. Far from clashing with one another, these appeals are combined in multiple and complex ways. We cannot say that one party or leader is populist while another is more technocratic. Rather, political strategies involve various combinations of populism and technocracy. In short, we live in a technopopulist age. The crucial difference with the traditional understanding of technocracy is that technopopulism does not describe a shift of decision-making power from political entities to independent bodies. This sort of depoliticisation still exists, of course, but technopopulism is something different. It is not an alternative to democracy; it is the form that democratic politics takes today. We have been accustomed to viewing political competition as a struggle between left and right. We should think about it instead as competition between rival ways of synthesising appeals to ``the people'' and appeals to expertise. **** The Conservatives' election-winning slogan of 2019 \textendash{} ``Get Brexit Done'' \textendash{} was powerfully technopopulist. It was a promise to do ``what the people want'', namely, leave the European Union \textendash{} but it was also a promise to do it promptly and efficiently. The pledge to act entailed a claim about competence and expertise, which fed off a growing disillusionment with the stalemate in the House of Commons. The Labour Party's response to this slogan \textendash{} ``Get Brexit Right'' \textendash{} is itself firmly rooted in the technopopulist register. Keir Starmer pits his promise of precision against Johnson's promise of swiftness, but both entail claims to a form of political competence. The concept of technopopulism helps to unravel the mystery of Dominic Cummings's centrality to the Johnson government and the manner in which he became the object of public opprobrium in May this year, after revelations about his trips to the north-east during lockdown. Cummings ruminates obsessively about the potential of cutting-edge science and technology to improve government performance; he writes rambling blog posts on the 17th-century German polymath Leibniz and the Apollo space programme; he is waging a war against the civil service. At the same time, Cummings is Britain's arch-populist agitator. In 2004, he was instrumental in the campaign against the Labour government's proposal for a North East Assembly. His winning slogans \textendash{} ``vote no to more politicians'' and ``politicians talk, we pay'' \textendash{} capitalised on public distrust of the political class and were precursors to the Leave campaign in 2016. In the early autumn of 2019, Cummings was a key figure in pushing the government towards its showdown with parliament, arguing that the Commons and the Lords had become obstacles to the exercise of popular sovereignty. Cummings thus in many ways embodies this new combination of populism and technocracy. **** Technopopulism is not just a British story. In the United States, Donald Trump's coruscating attacks on expert opinion belie a more nuanced set of developments. When he ran against Hillary Clinton in 2016, it was common to view the contest as that of a populist against a seasoned and highly competent politician. And yet, Trump's political persona made much of his practical ability to do deals and ``get the job done'', in contrast to his Democratic predecessor. Trump has, perhaps, most in common with Italy's Silvio Berlusconi. Derided by outside observers, Berlusconi successfully cultivated a personal and direct relationship with Italians via television and by politicising his entrepreneurial success. At the core of Italian politics under Berlusconi, as with Trump, has been this amalgamation of a personal bond with citizens and a managerial approach to politics. While much has been written about the dangers of this overlapping of money with politics, we should pay as much attention to the exact meanings of expertise and popular representation contained in Berlusconism or Trumpism. Since the coronavirus pandemic began, Trump's strategy has not been to dismiss all expert opinion out of hand. Instead, he has deployed ``his'' experts. He has also made much of his ability to read data and provide his own interpretations. Political debate in the United States has been along the lines of ``my expert versus yours'', not a simple clash between populism and technocracy.  Flanked by experts: Anthony Fauci, Mike Pence and Donald Trump face the press, February 2020. Credit: Alex Wong / Getty  Variations in technopopulism therefore come from different ways of mobilising ``the people'' and by focusing on different understandings of techne. Elected in 2017, French president Emmanuel Macron's attack on the political class and his unabashedly messianic political style had all the hallmarks of the populist politician. In a striking instance of the populist's personalised approach to exercising power, Macron even gave his political movement the same initials as himself: En Marche!. But Macron was also a product of France's statist and elitist technocratic system. He used the language of competence to attack his opponents. A key turning point in the last presidential election was the second televised debate on 3 May 2017, when far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen made a series of factual errors culminating in an incoherent account of how she would take France out of the euro. In his response, Macron chided Le Pen in the manner of a teacher disappointed at his student's poor performance. You could at least have prepared for this debate rather than trying to wing it, he scolded. Le Pen never recovered. Macron's brand of technopopulism is unabashedly top-down. He thinks of himself as the people's problem-solver. His concept of techne, drawn from the upper echelons of the French meritocracy, is put to the service of ``the people''. As Macron argued in his memoir-cum-political programme, Revolution, ``the French are less interested in representation than in action. They want politicians to be efficient, and that's all there is to it.'' In recent months, Macron has had to recalibrate the balance between his populist and technocratic components. His decision this summer to change his prime minister was a way of forging a more direct and ``human'' connection with voters. In place of the stiff and technocratic \'Edouard Philippe, Macron chose Jean Castex \textendash{} a mayor of a small town in the south of France, who speaks with a southern accent and has the popular touch his predecessor lacked. Italy's Five Star Movement (M5S) is a bottom-up form of technopopulism. Currently in a coalition government with the centre-left Democratic Party, the M5S is usually associated with its charismatic founder, Beppe Grillo, a comedian-turned-politician who built a popular movement out of anger and frustration at Italian political life. Grillo's promise to do away with the political caste and replace it with a more direct form of democracy was enormously successful: founded in 2009 as a small online movement, in the 2013 general election the M5S received more votes than any other party. Grillo's anti-establishment message galvanised a generation of political discontents, but the M5S is not a purely populist movement. The ``five stars'' refer to the movement's central goals of environmentalism, internet connectivity, and sustainable water, transport and development. These are concrete policy ambitions, not grand ideological principles. The philosophy behind the M5S, articulated by the web guru and co-founder Gianroberto Casaleggio, was that the internet and digital connectivity were a means of harnessing the ``collective intelligence'' of humanity. Direct democracy through the web was the route to better policymaking. As Casaleggio once put it, ``the web makes us equal in being smart.'' The Five Star Movement thus combines populism and technocracy by arguing everyone is an expert. The internet and direct citizen participation help pool the knowledge and competence of the general population. Citizens are at the heart of the M5S, but as holders of knowledge rather than as bearers of rights. Dominic Cummings's demand on 2 January this year that ``weirdos and misfits'' apply for jobs in No 10 had something of Grillo and Casaleggio to it. But British technopopulism relies on a traditional party structure and eschews Italian experiments with digital democracy. **** The language of expertise and competence is almost as old as democracy itself. The same is true of ``the people'' and attempts to mobilise popular will. So what exactly has changed? From the middle of the 19th century until the final years of the 20th century, democratic politics was about a clash between rival ideologies: between the left and the right. These ideologies were not devices deployed by cynical politicians. They were the building blocks of society, taking precedence over general appeals to ``the people'' or to the competence of politicians and their advisers. The clash of ideologies was embodied in the most significant creation of the early 20th century, the mass party of the left and of the right. As Hans Fallada put it in Alone in Berlin (1947), his celebrated novel about resistance to Nazi rule in wartime Berlin: ``The party was everything, and the people nothing.'' Ideologies were more than political rhetoric; they gave societies their substance and structure. Conservative and Labour traditions in the UK were a way of life, as were Christian democracy and social democracy in Germany or Italy. In the Netherlands, ideology divided society so much that the country's social structure was imagined as a series of independent pillars, existing side by side but never overlapping. Life in a pillar was all-encompassing, taking in your football club, your school, your preferred newspaper and even the caf\'e at which you would drink and socialise. As the structuring power of rival ideologies has declined, so the force of ``the people'' as a political slogan has grown. Individualism has eroded these distinctive social groups, leaving political parties without any roots. As free-floating politicians, they coin empty slogans in the hope of winning over as many voters as possible. The prominence of competence and expertise in our political vocabulary has its origins in the rise of meritocracy, what political scientists like to call ``cognitive mobilisation''. By investing intellectual ability with a moral superiority, many of those near the top of the meritocratic ladder feel justified in demanding that politicians should resemble themselves. Synthesising these appeals to ``the people'' and to expertise gives us technopopulism \textendash{} the new political logic of our age. **** If technopopulism is the key to making sense of Johnsonism as a political philosophy, it is also the way we can grasp its weakness and superficiality. At the time of the electoral victory in late 2019, there was much talk of a fundamental ideological reordering of British politics, one where working-class voters of the north of England were willing \textendash{} for the first time in their lives \textendash{} to vote Conservative. Cummings and others around him in Downing Street spoke grandly of a new social contract. Less than a year later, it has all come apart, dramatically so. Johnson cuts a lonely figure and there is talk about him quitting in the New Year. The most discontented on the Tory back benches include those from so-called Red Wall seats, where expectations about a ``levelling up'' agenda are highest. The origins of technopopulism as a political logic lie in a separation of politics from society. Ideologies provided the glue that kept social groups and political representatives together. As this glue has disappeared, a gap has opened up between voters and governments. Technopopulism is more a consequence of this void than it is a way of filling it. As a result, politics is no longer a reflection of shifting class cleavages and social structures. It is far more superficial and disconnected than that. Technopopulism as a political logic means politicians can \textendash{} simultaneously \textendash{} appeal to all voters while promising them magical technocratic fixes that are ``right'' or ``true'', and do not involve trading the interests of one group against the interests of another. But we should not equate an individualised and atomised society with an equal society. Deep conflicts of interest persist even if they are not utilised in the old ways. Technopopulism is thus a product of the void between voters and their politicians, and its practitioners are constantly being undone by this void. It is a persistent form of politics, but also a deeply unstable one. One important source of instability is that politicising expertise erodes its authority, which stems precisely from being ``outside'' of politics. The trouble with politicising expertise is that we quickly realise there is no necessary or direct connection between what we know and what we ought to do. This has been one of the great lessons of the pandemic. Simply ``following the science'' cannot work because scientific evidence and models are themselves both open to question and fall far short of providing instructions about what to do in any given set of circumstances. At the heart of politics is the need to make decisions based not only on facts but also on a set of beliefs that provide a framework for action. Stripped of an ideological outlook that contains within it some vision of future society, decision-making dissolves into problem-solving. This leads to the endless firefighting and U-turns that have characterised the British response to Covid-19. The relative success of the German response to the pandemic is not because of a stronger technocratic commitment to ``following the science''. It is simply because of the structure of the German state. Its federal model \textendash{} with substantial powers given to the individual states or L\"ander \textendash{} meant that the test and trace system developed early on in the pandemic came from the bottom-up, using private and public laboratories, and tracing capacity was built up by individual municipalities. At the same time, the country has continued to fund its welfare state, focusing on healthcare because of its ageing population. The decentralised structure of the German state and the quality of its health system are nothing to do with scientific expertise as such; they reflect the social settlements of the past and the present. There is something self-defeating about trying to make truth the foundation of political action, whether it be the truth of ``the people'' or the truth provided by expert knowledge. The anti-Trump ``truth campaigns'' in the US led by the New York Times (``the truth isn't red or blue\ldots{} the truth is hard\ldots{} the truth is under attack''), have failed because deploying truth as a political weapon strips it of the objectivity that made it politically valuable in the first place. There is no truth in politics. There is only the balance of social forces that dictates the way in which we interpret our political and social world. What matters is the power that comes from being able to build coalitions and majorities strong enough to implement a political programme. An appeal to ``the people'' is also an unstable and fragile source of political authority. Brexit is a useful lesson here. The demand that the government trigger Article 50 immediately after the June 2016 referendum was justified as being ``what the people want''. The gap between this appeal to popular will and the lack of a defined plan for the UK's exit from the EU was wide enough to shape events long after the vote had taken place. The difficulty of filling it ended Theresa May's premiership and locked the UK into a negotiating process where the options were limited by the ticking clock started by triggering Article 50. Behind any appeal to ``what the people want'' lies the need to transform popular will into a political platform with actual social content. For over a century, political parties have done this while working within the rules of representative democracy. But parties can only do this if they are a bridge between society and politics. **** The pandemic has demonstrated how wide the gap can be between what Rousseau called the will of all and the general will. The will of all refers to the will of everyone in the political community; the general will is more complex, usually going against the individual interests of some members of the community. When competence and government performance are all that we discuss in relation to Covid-19, we neglect the much more difficult discussion of how we should manage the conflicts of interest that run through our societies. For instance, what of the inter-generational transfer of wealth that comes with an approach focused on saving the lives of the most vulnerable, but paid for by the least vulnerable? These are the sorts of deeper political questions that we should be discussing and worrying about, but our technopopulist age reduces political debate to a synthesis of appeals to ``the people'' and to expertise. This political logic has its roots in the decline of class-based identities and in a moralised celebration of competence, one of the worst features of our meritocratic societies. Technopopulism is unstable and unappealing, but it is likely to be with us for some time to come.  Chris Bickerton teaches politics at the University of Cambridge. His book on technopopulism, written with Carlo Invernizzi Accetti, will be published by Oxford University Press early next year},

This paper shows how a text analysis pipeline of structural and statistical approaches to natural language processing (NLP) can be deployed to tackle ethos by mining linguistic resources from the political domain. We summarise a coding scheme for annotating ethotic expressions; present the first openly available corpus to support further, comparative research in the area; and report results from a system for automatically recognising the presence and polarity of ethotic expressions. Finally, we hypothesise that in the political sphere, ethos analytics \textendash{} including recognising who trusts whom and who is attacking whose reputation \textendash{} might act as a powerful toolset for understanding and even anticipating the dynamics of governments. By exploring several examples of correspondence between ethos analytics in political discourse and major events and dynamics in the political landscape, we uncover tantalising evidence in support of this hypothesis.},

  abstract = {"Fake news," wild conspiracy theories, misleading claims, doctored photos, lies peddled as facts, facts dismissed as lies--citizens of democracies increasingly inhabit a public sphere teeming with competing claims and counterclaims, with no institution possessing the authority to settle basic disputes in a definitive way. The problem may be novel in some of its details--including the role of political leaders, along with broadcast and digital media, in intensifying the epistemic anarchy--but the challenge of determining truth in a democratic world has a backstory. In this lively and illuminating book, historian Sophia Rosenfeld explores a longstanding and largely unspoken tension at the heart of democracy between the supposed wisdom of the crowd and the need for information to be vetted and evaluated by a learned elite made up of trusted experts. What we are witnessing now, under the pressure of populism, is the unraveling of the d tente between these competing aspects of democratic culture. In four bracing chapters, Rosenfeld substantiates her claim by tracing the history of the vexed relationship between democracy and truth. She begins with an examination of the period prior to the eighteenth-century Age of Revolutions, where she uncovers the political and epistemological foundations of our democratic world. Subsequent chapters move from the Enlightenment to the rise of technocratic notions of democracy during the nineteenth century to the troubling trends--including the collapse of social trust--that have led to the rise of our "post-truth" public life. Rosenfeld concludes by offering suggestions for how to defend the idea of an extra-political truth against the forces that would undermine it.},

Some have seen in this the promise of a free and equal relationship between society and the individual, while others have seen it as nothing less than a blueprint for totalitarianism.

To close this gap in scholarship, we have created a taxonomy of technocracy that identifies three things: 1) the central domains where technocracy emerges, 2) the basic means by which technocratic power is instantiated, and 3) the quintessential types of harms technocratic discipline engenders. To demonstrate the explanatory power of the taxonomy, we apply it to Silicon Valley and clarify how this contemporary example of technocracy relates to past instances.},

Many governments operations had been privatized in all three countries, and new management techniques had been introduced.

Is government now better in these countries, and was political leadership right in focusing on management of the bureaucracy as the villain?

The analysis identifies distinct models of `one way' discourses, reflecting political cultures and institutional settings and providing discursive trajectories. We examine the motivation for invoking necessity to justify unpalatable and normatively intricate policy decisions, and understand TINA politics in its double effect: as facilitating certain policies yet obstructing democratic and deliberative procedures. This allows us to address the question of whether the politics of our time shows a disposition to TINA as a means of responding to the rise and fall of political steering optimism.},

  abstract = {Research shows that five strategies correlate with the successful completion of a dissertation:Establishing a consistent writing routineWorking with a support groupConsulting your advisorUnderstanding your committee's expectationsSetting a realistic and timely schedule Building on these insights, this book is for anyone who needs help in preparing for, organizing, planning, scheduling, and writing the longest sustained writing project they have encountered, particularly if he or she is not receiving sufficient guidance about the process, but also for anyone looking to boost his or her writing productivity. The author uncovers much tacit knowledge, provides advice on working with dissertation advisors and committee members, presents proven techniques for the prewriting and writing stages of the dissertation, sets out a system for keeping on schedule, and advocates enlisting peer support.  As Peg Boyle Single states, ``my goal is quite simple and straightforward: for you to experience greater efficiency and enjoyment while writing. If you experience anxiety, blocking, impatience, perfectionism or procrastination when you write, then this system is for you. I want you to be able to complete your writing so that you can move on with the rest of your life.''  Few scholars, let alone graduate students, have been taught habits of writing fluency and productivity. The writing skills imparted by this book will not only help the reader through the dissertation writing process, but will serve her or him in whatever career she or he embarks on, given the paramount importance of written communication, especially in the academy.  This book presents a system of straightforward and proven techniques that are used by productive writers, and applies them to the dissertation process. In particular, it promotes the concept of writing networks \textendash{} whether writing partners or groups \textendash{} to ensure that writing does not become an isolated and tortured process, while not hiding the need for persistence and sustained effort. This book is intended for graduate students and their advisers in the social sciences, the humanities, and professional fields. It can further serve as a textbook for either informal writing groups led by students or for formal writing seminars offered by departments or graduate colleges. The techniques described will help new faculty advice their students more effectively and even achieve greater fluency in their own writing.},

In this latter period the creation of collaborative institutions has become a core strategy in all areas of UKpublic policy. This rich web of linkages arose in response to the problems inherent in the fragmentation arising from hollowing-out. The resulting partnerships bring together public, private, voluntary and community sector actors. They operate between and around the core institutions of democratic government. These tertiary (partnership) structures have complex accountability relationships with primary (elected) and secondary (appointed) public bodies, as well as with other actors. The example of Northshire shows how inter-linked strategic and specific partnership boards create an alternative, collaborative governance structure for a locality which is largely outside democratic processes. This development has fundamental implications for our appreciation of the institutional framework of UK government, as well asfor the debate about andpractice ofdemocratic renewal.},

As long as people have investigated social life, there has been recurrent fascination with juxtaposing historical patterns from two or more times or places. Part of the appeal comes from the general usefulness of looking at historical trajectories in order to study social change. Indeed, practitioners of comparative history from Alexis de Tocqueville and Max Weber to Marc Bloch, Reinhard Bendix, and Barrington Moore, Jr. have typically been concerned with understanding societal dynamics and epochal transformations of cultures and social structures. Attention to historical sequences is indispensable to such understanding. Obviously, though, not all investigations of social change use explicit juxtapositions of distinct histories. We may wonder, therefore: What motivates the use of comparisons as opposed to focussing on single historical trajectories? What purposes are pursued\textemdash and how\textemdash through the specific modalities of comparative history?},

  abstract = {In his seminal 1968 study of Francis Bacon's political thought, Howard B. White argued that the New Atlantis is ``a rewriting of a Platonic myth, and a rewriting clearly intended as a refutation.'' Bacon's attack on Plato, however, is partially mediated through his critique of Christianity. Indeed, Bacon pays more explicit attention to the tropes and themes of revealed religion than he does to those of the story of the ``old'' Atlantis told in Plato's Timaeus and Critias. Scholars are divided as to the exact nature of Bacon's intentions in his treatment of religion in the New Atlantis. Richard Tuck suggests that ``the desire for a reconstructed religion'' is ``explicit in the blend of Protestantism and Judaism'' created by Bacon. Most scholars, however, unlike Tuck, argue that Bacon was more interested in undermining religion\textemdash or more specifically, its political authority\textemdash than in reconstructing it. Laurence Lampert's argument that Bacon stands at the head of ``the actual holy war fought in Europe .~.~., the warfare of science against religion that tamed sovereign religion'' typifies much of the scholarly commentary on the New Atlantis since White's reading of it almost forty years ago. The consensus view is that Bacon promotes the politic manipulation of the tropes and themes of revealed religion so that they might be made to support the modern scientific project and the cause of peace from religious strife: ``Bacon's lifelong concern for religion uniformly expressed itself in arguments for moderation in religion.'' White argues that Bacon demonstrates how ``religious turmoil'' can be countered ``not only by religious toleration, but also by religious eclecticism, amounting to religious universality.''},

In this lively and persuasive book, Jake Soll has given us a third Colbert, the information manager."---Peter Burke, University of Cambridge"Jacob Soll gives us a road map drawn from the French state under Colbert. With a stunning attention to detail Colbert used knowledge in the service of enhancingroyal power. Jacob Soll's scholarship is impeccable and his story longoverdue and compelling."---Margaret Jacob, University of California, Los Angeles"Nowadays we all know that information is the key to power, and that the masters of information rule the world. Jacob Soll teaches us that Jean-Baptiste Colbert had grasped this principle three and a half centuries ago, and used it to construct a new kind of state. This imaginative, erudite, and powerfully written book re-creates the history of libraries and archives in early modern Europe, and ties them in a novel and convincing way to the new statecraft of Europe's absolute monarchs."---Anthony Grafton, Princeton University"Brilliantly researched, superbly told, and timely, Soll's story is crucial for the history of the modern state."---Keith Baker, Stanford UniversityWhen Louis XIV asked his minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert---the man who was to oversee the building of Versailles and the Royal Academy of Sciences, as well as the navy, the Paris police force, and French industry---to build a large-scale administrative government, Colbert created an unprecedented information system for political power. In The Information Master, Jacob Soll shows how the legacy of Colbert's encyclopedic tradition lies at the very center of the rise of the modern state and was a precursor to industrial intelligence and Internet search engines.Soll's innovative look at Colbert's rise to power argues that his practice of collecting knowledge originated from techniques of church scholarship and from Renaissance Italy, where merchants recognized the power to be gained from merging scholarship, finance, and library science. With his connection of interdisciplinary approaches---regarding accounting, state administration, archives, libraries, merchant techniques, ecclesiastical culture, policing, and humanist pedagogy---Soll has written an innovative book that will redefine not only the history of the reign of Louis XIV and information science but also the study of political and economic history.Jacket illustration: Jean Baptiste Colbert (1619\textendash 1683), Philippe de Champaigne, 1655, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Gift of the Wildenstein Foundation, Inc., 1951 (51.34).

Thorstein Veblen, in The Engineers and the Price System, gave a systematic treatment of that analysis. But Veblen's approach to political economy was broader than that of the engineers. His understanding of social change was based on a two-part research program: First, recognize the institutional elements of social stability; then identify an operative force with technological values that could foster change. When applied to the U.S. of his day, this research program resulted in Veblen's seeing a conflict between pecuniary and industrial values. Veblen believed that the triumph of industrial values was crucial for making society compatible with mass-production technology. These values were held to by both engineers and industrial workers. Veblen's earlier works emphasized workers as being agents for social change; later he shifted his focus to engineers. In both cases he reacted to the social activism of each group.},

When Saint-Simon's writings first appeared, they aroused little more than amusement and curiosity. The ideas they contained \textendash{} ideas concerning the application of scientific method to the study of man and society, the coming of the new 'scientific-industrial' age in which the State would assume responsibility for promoting social welfare, the prospects for international cooperation and integration in Europe, man's need for a secular religion \textendash{} were widely dismissed. But the boldness and originality of Saint-Simon's work had a lasting impact on subsequent thinkers and played a major role in the development of European social thought throughout the nineteenth and into the twentieth centuries.Keith Taylor's introductory essay places Saint-Simon's writings in their proper historical context, offers a penetrating reassessment of their significance as a contribution to social theory, and considers the extent of their influence on modern thought. It indicates the inadequacies of many previous interpretations of Saint-Simon's thinking, and highlights, in particular, the tendency of most recent commentators to disregard some crucial features of his political philosophy. This selection is an essential insight into a modern understanding of Saint-Simon from a young English scholar. Nowhere else in English may be found so wide-ranging a selection from Saint-Simon's writings presenting such a balanced view of his thought.},

Hypotheses about the conditions under which pledges are more likely to be acted upon are formulated and tested. Although clear linkages between election programmes and subsequent policies are found, pledges made by prospective coalition parties in the Netherlands are less likely to be acted upon than those made by prospective governing parties in the United Kingdom. Prominent features of cabinet government, such as the allocation of ministerial portfolios and the coalition policy agreement, are found to influence the likelihood of pledges being fulfilled. In addition, consensus between parties is also found to increase the likelihood of government actions responding to election pledges.},

In doing so, governments have sought not only to shape expectations for electoral purposes but to construct broader narratives about how 'the economy' should be understood. The starting point of this work is to ask why these goals have been focussed upon (and differentially over time), how they have been constructed to appeal to the population, and, insofar as this can be assessed, how far the population has accepted these narratives. The first half of the book analyses the development of the major narratives from the 1940s onwards, addressing the notion of 'austerity' and its particular meaning in the 1940s; the rise of a narrative of 'economic decline from the late 1950s, and the subsequent attempts to 'modernize' the economy; the attempts to 'roll back the state' from the 1970s; the impact of ideas of 'globalization' in the 1900s; and, finally, the way the crisis of 2008/9 onwards was constructed as a problem of 'debts and deficits'. The second part of the book focuses on four key issues in attempts to 'manage the people': productivity, the balance of payments, inflation, and unemployment. It shows how, in each case, governments sought to get the populace to understand these issues in a particular light, and shaped strategies to that end.},

Is there one universal system of norms, by which all sorts of arguments in all sorts of fields must be judged, or must each sort of argument be judged according to its own norms? In The Uses of Argument (1958) Toulmin sets out his views on these questions for the first time. In spite of initial criticisms from logicians and fellow philosophers, The Uses of Argument has been an enduring source of inspiration and discussion to students of argumentation from all kinds of disciplinary background for more than forty years.},

In its place, we have the recurring words ``practical'' and ``industrial.'' How did we get to this point? How did techne evolve from a multifaceted definition encompassing both the ``craft'' (the process of creation) and the ``knowledge'' (the reasoning behind the craft), into the contemporary term ``technology?'' How did our modern society come to think of technology as a concept referring to the tools of progress divorced from social ramifications and impacts? How did technology come to encompass ``classes'' as disparate as knowledge, objects, activities, processes and systems? In order to truly understand how technology has evolved into an ideograph of American social discourse in the age of the Internet, it is necessary to return to the Greek origins of the word. In this essay, I explore the disconnect between scholarly concerns regarding the socio-political problems related to technology and the vernacular understanding of the term technology.},

This book examines the challenge that unelected bodies present to democracy and argues that, taken together, such bodies should be viewed as a new branch of government with their own sources of legitimacy and held to account through a new separation of powers. Vibert suggests that such bodies help promote a more informed citizenry because they provide a more trustworthy and reliable source of information for decisions.

These argument forms are then further described and illustrated by means of concrete examples, and it is explained how they are visually represented in the Periodic Table of Arguments.},

It served to popularize and vindicate the sale of state utilities around the world. This article shows how computer models of the future were central for British telecommunications', and thus for Britain's, transition from social democracy to neoliberalism, from monopoly to market. The British telecommunications network was a key interest in both the social democratic and neoliberal British state's plans for the digitalization of Britain. I argue that computers were crucial to the rise of neoliberalism, both as a managerial tool that simulated futures of free markets and as a technology that symbolized and supported the contraction of the British state. This article traces the history of the British telecommunications system's Long Range Planning Department, which was at the heart of British Telecom's privatization. In doing so, it argues that the history of technology is in a unique position to study how tools such as computers both forecast and symbolize the political power of the future.},

It examines the evolution of economic and social policies at the national, European and global level and expands beyond the European Economic Community (EEC) by analysing the various solutions envisaged by European decision-makers towards regulating globalization, including the creation of the Single Market. Based on extensively examined archives of transnational actors, international organizations and focusing on the governments of France, Germany and the UK, as well as the European Commission, the book uncovers deep, previously unknown, economic divisions among these actors and the roles they played in the success of the EEC.

While in modern times the prominence of the concept of moderation in the Muslim world has at times been obscured by binary categories of halal (allowed) and haram (forbidden), the principle of wasa\d{t}iyya (moderation) continues to function as a treasure trove for Muslim scholars seeking orthodox ways out of debilitating absolutes. However, it will be shown that appeals to moderateness have also been claimed by the most radical organizations, including Islamic State. The chapter will give us reason to reflect on how we can avoid the concept of moderation ending up as an empty vessel of relativity.},

  abstract = {The general election of 1945 is described as `the Waterloo of the Conservative party'. Yet, in 1951 the Conservatives returned to power and were to remain in office for thirteen years. The purpose of this article is to examine this transformation in electoral fortunes. Labour's defeat in 1951 is usually explained in terms of government fatigue, redistribution, and Liberal disintegration. It is argued here that the Conservative party was not just a passive beneficiary of these developments. Rather, the 1951 result was the outcome of a sustained effort since 1946 to regain the initiative and political power. The Conservatives were actively engaged in forging an anti-socialist coalition focused on disaffection with austerity, rationing and controls on which the party's recovery after 1945 is based. The discussion is divided into four sections. The first outlines the extent of shortages, establishes the significance of this issue in political debate, and identifies the social groups most affected. Part two traces the swing to the right from 1947 onwards and the third section explores Conservative propaganda in opposition to rationing, austerity and controls. The final part examines the party's assessment of the electoral task, its monitoring of public opinion, and the range of techniques employed to rally support.},
