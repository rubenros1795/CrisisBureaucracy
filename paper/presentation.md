# Rising Waters. The Concept of "Bureaucracy'' and the Crisis of Government in Great-Britain 1957-1979



## Introduction

### Overload and the Rising Waters

- Anthony King, *Overload. Crisis of Governing in the 1970s* (1975)

  > The enlargement of the public sector has led to increased burdens being placed on government; the increased burdens placed on government have contributed to the enlarging of the public sector.

- "opened the discursive terrain" by evoking the image of an "unsustainable disequilibrium" (Hay, 2004)

  > Today our image of government is more that of the sorcererâ€™s apprentice. The waters rise. The apprentice rushes about with his bucket. The waters rise even faster. And none of us knows when, or whether, the magician will come home

### Overload and the New Right Turn in History and Historiography

- The "overload thesis" as the central component of the New Right's critique on Keynesian government
- The return of the magician: Margaret Thatcher's victory in 1979
- The intellectual history of Thatcherism and the New Right: 
  - The "discursive construction of crisis" (Hay, 1996) and "Knightean uncertainty" (Blyth, 2002)
  - Historiographical focus on economic policy and keynesianism
  - Overload of *government*
- The concept of bureaucracy as a window on the long(er)-term discursive construction of crisis:
  - evades the historiographical temporality of the Thatcherite "moment"
  - draws the attention to long-term changes in discourse
  - reinstates non-Conservative ideas

### Approach: Bureaucracy as a concept and argumentative apparatus

- The concept of bureaucracy  
- Argumentative Apparatus
  - size
  - efficiency
  - cost
  - accountability
  - freedom
  - irrationality
- Changes in the argumentative apparatus
- Data
  - Newspapers (*The Times* and *The Guardian*)
  - Party Documents (Manifestos, Fabian Tracts, treatises)
- Approach: digital history!
  - frequency analysis
  - collocation analysis
  - text classification
  - word embeddings

### I - Bureaucracy in the 1950s and 1960s

- Figurative use
- The Soviet spectre

### II - Efficiency and Temporalisation 1964-1970

- Wilson's agenda: efficiency and modernistaion
  - Fabianism & Centre Left Technocrats
  - The Fulton Report
- Early debates
  - 1968: Motion on "The Growth of Bureaucracy"
  - **temporalisation**

### III - Heath, Europe and Increasing Topicality 1970 - 1974/75

- Europe and devolution
- Labour's participation
- Effects: topicality and politicization

  > at a time when so many politicians on all sides express their concern about the growth of impersonal and remote bureaucracy in Britain and the need for effective devolution and finding new ways of democratic participation, it is odd that we should be so ready to move into an international group which has a still more powerful bureaucracy over which it will be even more difficult to exercise control. Judd, 20-01-1971


### IV - Crisis, Callaghan and the Sorcerer's Return

- A sense of crisis: IMF surrender, declinism, inflation
- Diagnosis: overload in context (neo-conservatives, Brittan, Jay)
- Conservative diagnosis: think tanks and ideological contemplation
- Substantialisation:
	- bureaucracy as central part of socialist tyranny
	- the aesthetics bureaucracy as part of moral conservatism
- Substantialisation of the argumentative apparatus:
	- cost
	- freedom / accountability
- Labour alignment:
  - far left on power of the mandarins
  - moderates on civil service collaboration
  - social democrat militancy and dissidents
